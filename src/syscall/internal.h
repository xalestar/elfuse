 *
 * Lock ordering (acquire in ascending order to prevent deadlocks). This is
 * every file-scope lock in the tree that is ever held across another
 * acquisition, whether the inner one is taken directly or through a call. The
 * leaf list below closes it: a lock named there holds nothing beneath it, so
 * the pair of lists is exhaustive rather than "the ones that seemed worth
 * writing down". Adding a mutex or an rwlock means placing it here or in the
 * leaf list, and a leaf that grows a call to another locker moves up here.
 *
 * Per-instance locks (one per epoll instance, futex bucket, FUSE session) are
 * named beside the file-scope lock they nest under. That pairing is the whole
 * of their ordering except for the FUSE session lock, which also holds fd_lock
 * and sig_lock beneath it: fuse_queue_request_locked runs with the session lock
 * held and reaches asyncio_fire, which snapshots an fd and queues a signal.
 * fuse_lock is always dropped before the session lock is used that way, so the
 * two claims do not meet.
 *
 * That path, in acquisition order:
 *
 *            ┌───────────┐
 *            │ fuse_lock │
 *            └───────────┘
 *                  │
 *   ┌──────────────▾──────────────┐

 *
 * cwd_lock is not drawn above it. It nests fuse_lock beneath it on the one path
 * that pairs them, and fuse_path_matches_mount drops fuse_lock before returning
 * into the cwd view, so cwd_lock is released before any session is pinned and
 * never reaches the rest of this chain.
 *
 * The numbered "Lock order: N" comments at the definitions predate this list
 * and are not indices into it. This list is the document; a number there says
 * only which locks that one was known to precede when it was written.
 *
 *   proc_tmpdir_lock (runtime/procemu.c): lazy /proc snapshot tree; holds
 *                                     mmap_lock beneath it, because
 *                                     ensure_proc_tmpdir builds the

 *                                     through proc_intercept_open while the
 *                                     lock is held. Above mmap_lock, so
 *                                     mmap_lock's "1" means first among the
 *                                     locks a syscall path takes, not that
 *                                     nothing precedes it
 *   mmap_lock    (syscall/mem.c):     mmap/brk allocators + page tables
 *   pt_lock      (core/guest.c):      page table pool allocator

 *                                     take it in this direction, which is what
 *                                     keeps them from deadlocking each other
 *   oom_write_lock (runtime/procemu.c): /proc/self/oom_score_adj writer; holds

 *   fd_lock      (syscall/fdtable.c): FD table (alloc/close/dup)
 *   epoll inst   (syscall/poll.c):    per-epoll-instance regs[]; taken under
 *                                     fd_lock by the close hook, taken alone
 *                                     (no fd_lock held) by epoll_ctl/pwait

 *                                     to run the request that frees the slot
 *   sig_lock     (syscall/signal.c):  signal handlers/pending/blocked
 *   thread_lock  (runtime/thread.c):  thread table
 *   sfd_lock     (syscall/fd.c):      special fd (never held with thread_lock)

 *                                     cwd_lock dropped
 *   pid_lock     (syscall/proc.c):    process table / wait state
 *   pidfd_lock   (syscall/proc-pidfd.c): pidfd registry
 *   futex bucket (runtime/futex.c):   per-bucket, index-ordered if >1
 *   cwd_lock     (syscall/proc-state.c): cached guest cwd. A leaf on every
 *                                     path but one: proc_acquire_cwd_view
 *                                     returns still holding it, and both
 *                                     callers that inspect view.path in place
 *                                     (sys_faccessat, fuse_resolve_at_path)
 *                                     call fuse_path_matches_mount inside the
 *                                     view, so fuse_lock nests beneath it
 *   fuse_lock    (syscall/fuse.c):    mount/session registry; holds the
 *                                     per-session session->lock beneath it,
 *                                     which is what pins a session against
 *                                     daemon exit while a request is in flight
 *   inotify_lock (syscall/inotify.c): inotify watch table
 *   usbdev_table_lock (syscall/usbdev.c): FD_USBDEV side table. It is never
 *                                     held together with the per-entry usbdev
 *                                     lock: usbdev_acquire and
 *                                     usbdev_fd_cleanup both find their entry
 *                                     under the table lock, drop it, and only
 *                                     then take the entry lock, because a sync
 *                                     transfer can hold that lock for a whole
 *                                     timeout and no other fd may wait behind
 *                                     it. What keeps the slot from being torn
 *                                     down and reused in between is the refs
 *                                     and dead pair the lookup sets under the
 *                                     table lock, not a nesting. The per-entry
 *                                     lock does hold the per-entry async_lock
 *                                     beneath it (usbdev_teardown_locked), and
 *                                     so does the table lock, one slot's at a
 *                                     time and never two at once: the cross-fd
 *                                     disconnect walk needs a consistent view
 *                                     of which slots are live while it stamps
 *                                     them. Never held together with any other
 *                                     file-scope lock in this list either, in
 *                                     either direction, so its position here is
 *                                     nominal
 *
 * Leaves. Each of these is the innermost lock on every path that takes it, so
 * it has no position in the order above and cannot be half of an inversion:
 *
 *   absock_lock (net-absock.c)       rlimit_lock (sys.c)
 *   log_mutex (debug/log.c)          rosettad_path_lock (rosetta.c)
 *   nl_lock (netlink.c)              session_lock (proc-identity.c)
 *   overlay_lock (chown-overlay.c)   shm_dir_lock (procemu.c)
 *   pipe_ring_lock (pipe-ring.c)     shm_lock (sysvipc.c)
 *   proc_scratch_lock (procemu.c)    syscpu_dir_lock (procemu.c)
 *   removed_overlay_lock (fs.c)      sysinfo_lock (sys.c)
 *                                    sysroot_lock (proc-state.c)
 *                                    usb_lock (runtime/usb-sysfs.c)
 *                                    usbdev_loop_lock (usbdev.c)
 *                                    usbdev_fixture_lock (usbdev-fixture.c)
 *   wake_lock (syscall/wakeup-pipe.c)
 *
 * log_mutex is the one leaf every other entry may hold: a lock anywhere in
 * either list can log while held. It sits below the whole order rather than
 * beside the rest of the leaves, and it acquires nothing itself, so it closes
 * no cycle.
 *
 * pt_lock, thread_lock, sfd_lock, pid_lock and pidfd_lock are leaves today too.
 * They stay in the ordered list because each is named as an inner lock above,
 * so the order they would be acquired in is the load-bearing fact about them.
 * sig_lock is not one of them: signal_queue_thread_common takes thread_lock
 * under it.

/* The same, for the directory fds a forked child inherits.
 *
 * The child receives the parent's descriptor over SCM_RIGHTS, so the two
 * processes hold one open file description, and the two halves of a union
 * listing are worth different things across it.
 *
 * The primary is shared and must be read. Darwin's fdopendir() reads one host
 * block ahead as it builds the stream and leaves the description just past it,
 * so what the parent's open() took is in the parent's memory and the rest of
 * the directory is still in the description for the child to read: measured
 * over the 403-name sysroot directory tests/test-dir-union-alias stages (macOS
 * 15.6, APFS), the parent's open takes 49 names and the child's stream reads
 * the remaining 354. A five-name directory fits inside that one block, which is
 * the whole reason a five-name measurement reads as all-or-nothing; it is not
 * what a directory of any width does. So the child's stream is built like any
 * other and walks its primary normally, and the split that falls out is real --
 * not Linux's split, but a partition, with nothing counted twice and nothing
 * dropped.
 *
 * The backing is not shared and must not be re-read. It is drained into
 * whichever stream first runs out of primary and held there as names, so a
 * child that drained one of its own would emit every backing name a second time
 * -- names the parent's stream still holds and goes on to deliver.
 * dir_stream_open() would do exactly that. This wrapper comes back with the
 * backing half marked private instead: the drain is skipped, the walk ends when
 * the primary does, and the parent delivers the backing once.
 *
 * The gap this leaves is a child whose parent closes its copy of the fd before
 * the backing is ever drained: nobody is left holding the half the parent owns,
 * and the child answers with its primary alone. Measured over the same two
 * fixtures, forking and closing the parent's fd at once gives the child 354 of
 * the plain directory's 403 names -- the 49 the parent's open had taken go with
 * it, which is the loss any inherited stream takes -- and 0 of the union's 405,
 * because that tree's synthetic half fits inside the block that open consumed.
 * Linux gives the child all 403. Closing it would mean keeping the position and
 * the union state in the description rather than in a DIR* one process owns,
 * which is a rewrite of every directory read and is not attempted here.
 *
 * Suppressing the whole walk rather than just the drain is the mistake this
 * interface exists to avoid, and it is not a small one. A stream created
 * already at the end of its listing never reads the primary at all, so the
 * block its own fdopendir() consumed is lost to both sides: measured over that
 * same 403-name directory, an unread fork came back with 352 names across the
 * pair instead of 403, with no error at either end.
 *
 * Linux keeps the position in the description and splits the listing there --
 * measured in docker (gcc 14.4, Linux 6.19 aarch64) over the same fork sequence
 * that lane runs, an unread directory fd forked and drained by the child gives
 * the child all 403 names and the parent 0, and draining the parent first gives
 * the parent all 403 and the child 0. elfuse cannot reproduce which side
 * delivers, because the block the open read ahead lives in a DIR* the opener
 * owns rather than in the description; what it can do, and what this preserves,
 * is deliver each name exactly once across the pair. Measured over that lane's
 * fixtures in all four states a parent can fork in -- unread, part-read, read
 * to the end, and forked then read by the parent first -- the plain 403-name
 * directory and the 405-name union each come back whole and without a repeat.
