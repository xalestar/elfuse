 * net/core/datagram.c and drivers/usb/core/devio.c at that tag, the last of
 * which v6.15 through v6.19 all carry unchanged (git blob f6ce6e26e0d4).
 *
 * epoll reads the same bits poll does -- eventpoll has no mask of its own, and
 * ep_item_poll masks the file's revents by epi->event.events (eventpoll.c:
 * 1044-1064) -- so a registration that named only EPOLLWRNORM is asking for one
 * of the two bits every writable file below raises, and must be woken by it. A
 * usbfs fd answers EPOLLOUT|EPOLLWRNORM while completions are reapable
 * (devio.c:2833-2847); so does a pipe with room (pipe.c:697) and a writable TCP
 * socket (tcp.c:606), while a unix socket and a datagram socket add EPOLLWRBAND
 * (af_unix.c:3417, datagram.c:976). Masked by the registration, all four hand
 * an EPOLLWRNORM-only guest EPOLLWRNORM, and none of them hands it nothing.
 *
 * Testing EPOLLOUT alone while poll() and select() answered the pair next door
 * was measured on both halves. usbfs: poll with POLLWRNORM alone returns rc=1
 * revents=0x100, epoll_wait with EPOLLWRNORM alone returns rc=0 after its full
 * 500 ms timeout, and the same registration with EPOLLOUT returns at once.
 * Generic: an EPOLLWRNORM-only ADD of a writable pipe armed no EVFILT_WRITE and
 * epoll_wait returned 0 after its full 500 ms timeout, while poll on the same
 * fd answered POLLWRNORM at once; EPOLLOUT|EPOLLWRNORM came back as EPOLLOUT
 * alone. Both halves therefore read the pair, the way the read half below does
 * and the way poll_eval_unpollable's POLL_WRITE_EVENTS always has.

/* And what "the guest asked to read" means, on every registration.
 *
 * The same rule read the other way: ep_item_poll masks the file's answer by
 * epi->event.events (eventpoll.c:1044-1064), so an EPOLLRDNORM-only
 * registration gets whatever the file reports AND EPOLLRDNORM. A pipe, a socket
 * or a tty reports EPOLLIN|EPOLLRDNORM when readable, so such a registration
 * both fires and is told EPOLLRDNORM rather than EPOLLIN; a usbfs fd reports
 * neither bit ever (devio.c:2833-2847), so it never fires there and all that
 * reaches it is the EPOLLERR|EPOLLHUP do_epoll_ctl ORs into every mask
 * (eventpoll.c:2351). Both outcomes need the read filter registered, which is
 * what gating on EPOLLIN alone did not do off the usbfs path: measured, an
 * EPOLLRDNORM-only ADD of a readable pipe armed nothing and epoll_wait returned
 * 0 after its full 500 ms timeout, while poll on the same fd answered
 * POLLRDNORM at once. The poll and select half of this file has read it as the
 * pair since it was written (poll_eval_unpollable and the ppoll remap).
 *
 * EPOLLPRI is deliberately absent, and is not defined anywhere in this file.
 * The conditions Linux raises it for -- socket out-of-band data, a sysfs
 * attribute poke -- are not modeled by this layer at all: no readiness source
 * below produces it, and the poll half only ever passes through a host POLLPRI
 * that a host fd raised on its own. So a registration naming only EPOLLPRI arms
 * no filter and hears nothing, the EPOLLERR|EPOLLHUP included. Mapping it onto
 * EVFILT_EXCEPT would be a guess about which of those two conditions the guest
 * meant, so this records what is not modeled instead of half-wiring it.
 *
 * EPOLLRDBAND (0x080) and EPOLLMSG (0x400) are absent for the same reason and
 * with the same consequence. Both are legal for a guest to name -- the mask is
 * not validated against a known set -- and the arming gate tests only
 * LINUX_EPOLL_READABLE and LINUX_EPOLLRDHUP, so a registration naming either
 * one alone arms no filter and never fires. Neither is left out by oversight:
 * no readiness source this layer serves raises them. EPOLLRDBAND is the
 * priority-band read bit, raised by the same out-of-band machinery as EPOLLPRI,
 * which nothing below models; EPOLLMSG is a legacy STREAMS bit that no file's
 * poll method sets. Defining either would mean picking a kqueue filter for a
 * condition this layer cannot produce, so, as above, the gap is written down
 * rather than half-wired.
