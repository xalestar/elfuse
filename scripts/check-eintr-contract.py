"""Fail when a syscall path can hand the guest EINTR without saying whether the
dispatcher may restart it.

The dispatcher restarts an interrupted SVC when the only thing that broke the
wait was an execve handed to the thread group leader (see syscall_restart_arm
in src/syscall/proc.h). Restarting re-executes the syscall with the guest's
original arguments, which is right for a wait that consumed nothing and wrong
for one that did: a relative timeout starts again from zero, and a request
already on the wire is sent twice. Both failure modes were shipped and then
found by review rather than by a test, twice, which is why this is a gate
rather than a convention.

Nothing in C makes that decision visible. A new interruptible wait is
restartable by default simply because the epilogue arms on any EINTR, so the
author of the next one has to know a rule that is not written down anywhere the
compiler can see. This script writes it down: every function that can hand the
guest EINTR is classified here, and the classification is checked against the
source rather than trusted.

Three classifications:

  forbids     The function calls syscall_restart_forbid(). Verified against the
              body, so the claim cannot go stale while the call is deleted.
  restartable Re-executing the syscall is harmless: the wait reports EINTR
              before transferring anything, consuming a deadline, or leaving
              host state behind. Needs a reason.
  not-a-wait  The EINTR does not come from a blocking wait at all (a teardown
              refusal, or handoff bookkeeping). Needs a reason.

Adding an interruptible wait therefore fails the build until its restart
behaviour is stated. Deleting one fails it too, so the inventory cannot rot
into a list of functions that no longer exist.

The unit is the function that decides, not the syscall that returns. A handler
forwarding a wait helper's result carries no EINTR expression of its own and is
not listed; the helper it called is, because that is where the wait happens and
where the decision belongs. Moving the annotation to syscall entry points would
name hundreds of forwarders and put the classification a long way from the code
it describes.

What this does not do is check every branch. It asks whether a function makes
a restart decision, not whether each of its EINTR exits makes the right one, so
a function with several exits that loses the call on one of them still passes.
Catching that needs the reasoning a reviewer does; this only guarantees that
the reasoning happened once and is written down.
