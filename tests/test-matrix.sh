# and in 'make check'.

# The two oom_adj/oom_score_adj sendfile-and-copy_file_range-interception
# subtests that used to make test-io-opt diverge here were split out into
# tests/test-oom-proc.c (make check only, not part of this matrix at all) -- see
# that file's header comment. test-io-opt itself is now pure portable
# sendfile/fsync/fallocate/copy_file_range coverage and runs against qemu like
# any other test.
#
# The entries below were added when run_unit_tests grew to cover the rest of
# tests/manifest.txt ("make check"). Each was verified against a live
# qemu-aarch64 boot before being listed here -- see the per-entry comment for
# the observed divergence. Do not add a test here just because it *might* behave
# differently; confirm it first the same way.

# test-session: getpgid/getsid/setsid assume the test is its own session and
#   process-group leader, true when elfuse launches it directly but not when
#   sshd execs it non-interactively -- a launcher artifact, not an elfuse
#   syscall bug.
# test-pidfd: pins pidfd_getfd(2) at elfuse's not-yet-implemented ENOSYS stub;
#   a real kernel implements it and returns success.
# test-userfaultfd: pins userfaultfd(2) at elfuse's not-yet-implemented ENOSYS
#   stub; a real kernel may implement it and return a usable fd.
# test-sigio: the F_SETOWN pgrp round-trip inherits test-session's launcher
#   artifact (own pgid assumption); F_SETOWN_EX with a negative pid also hits
#   a real kernel ESRCH-after-lookup path where elfuse rejects up front --
#   a minor validation-order gap worth a closer look separately.
# test-syscall-smoke: tee() between two empty pipes is stubbed to an
#   immediate EINVAL under elfuse; a real kernel attempts the real splice and
#   blocks waiting for data that this test never writes, since the source
#   pipe's write end is still held open.
# test-vdso: pins the exact PT_NOTE/dynamic-section layout of elfuse's own
#   hand-built vDSO image, which a real kernel's vDSO has no reason to match;
#   also assumes getcpu() always reports cpu 0 (elfuse models one online CPU),
#   which does not hold on the reference VM's 4 vCPUs.
# test-ioctl-cloexec: ioctl(FIOCLEX/FIONCLEX) on an O_PATH fd succeeds under
#   elfuse but returns EBADF on a real kernel -- elfuse is more permissive
#   than Linux here.
# test-pty: opening /dev/pts/N directly (and TIOCGPTPEER) fails with EIO on
#   the qemu reference lane's minimal Alpine initramfs, most likely a devpts
#   mount/config gap in that fixture rather than a syscall behavior gap.
# test-mprotect-mt: the RVAE1IS race-window thresholds were tuned against
#   elfuse's own vCPU/TLBI shootout timing; the qemu reference lane's nested
#   virtualization has different scheduling latency and trips the same
#   thresholds for real, unrelated races.
# test-clone3: CLONE_NEWPID succeeds on a real kernel (PID namespaces) but
#   elfuse has no namespace support and expects EINVAL; the mismatch derails
#   the rest of the scenario into a hang instead of a clean FAIL.
# test-fork-synthetic-fd: the first /dev/urandom read blocks -- the qemu
#   reference lane boots without a virtio-rng device, so the guest CRNG may
#   not be seeded yet this early after boot, while elfuse's urandom
#   emulation never blocks.
# test-mmap-hint / test-msync: pin mmap addresses against elfuse's own
#   deterministic placement heuristics (2 MiB-aligned hint fallback, a fixed
#   neighbor address); a real kernel's allocator places mappings differently.
# test-mremap-tail-emfile: fills the guest FD table, consumes elfuse's host
#   descriptor reserve with file-backed fillers, and verifies that the filler
#   failure is descriptor-driven before asserting the mremap ENOMEM path; real
#   Linux has neither emulated table nor reserve.
# test-credentials: pins elfuse's restricted "fakeroot" setuid/capset/
#   getgroups model (deliberately narrower than real root); the qemu
#   reference lane runs as genuine root, which has unrestricted privilege.
# test-fakeroot-exec: ELFUSE_FAKEROOT_EXEC is an elfuse-only escape hatch --
#   a real kernel has no notion of an executable that turns on fakeroot, so
#   the marked exec simply stays unprivileged there.
# test-setuid-exec / -fakeroot: reasons about elfuse's virtual chown overlay
#   and about host UIDs no sysroot maps into the guest, neither of which a
#   real kernel has; the qemu reference lane also runs as genuine root, where
#   a chown to any owner succeeds physically and setuid is honoured from it.
# test-sched-policy: exercises elfuse's explicitly-a-stub scheduler policy
#   layer (see the file's own header) -- RT class changes are always
#   -EPERM'd regardless of privilege, whereas real root can set them.
# test-rseq: the double-register and unregister-wrong-signature cases return
#   different results on the real kernel; root cause not fully pinned down
#   (possibly libc-level rseq interaction) -- flagged for follow-up rather
#   than silently assumed.
# test-tier-a: msgrcv(..., MSG_EXCEPT) is an elfuse ENOSYS stub; a real
#   kernel implements it and blocks waiting for a non-matching message that
#   this test never sends.
# test-syscall-fidelity: shares test-vdso's getcpu==0 assumption; several
#   openat2 RESOLVE_*/NO_MAGICLINKS cases targeting /dev/fd also return the
#   wrong errno, most likely because the reference initramfs never creates a
#   /dev/fd -> /proc/self/fd symlink (a fixture gap, not confirmed as an
#   elfuse behavior bug).
# test-fd-family: elfuse deliberately preserves a pending signal after an
#   EFAULT signalfd read; the real kernel drops it -- an intentional
#   improvement over a real Linux quirk, not a bug.
# test-scm-creds: SO_PEERCRED/SCM_CREDENTIALS assert elfuse's default
#   emulated guest identity (uid/gid 1000); the qemu reference lane runs as
#   real root (uid/gid 0).
# test-proc-fidelity: /proc/self/oom_score rejects a writable open outright
#   under elfuse, while a real kernel allows the open and only rejects the
#   write -- a genuine behavioral difference worth reviewing on its own,
#   not just an environment artifact.
# test-proc-smap: validates elfuse's synthetic smaps VMA snapshot, including
#   per-VMA Shared_Dirty inheritance and exclusion of post-fork VMAs. Real
#   Linux smaps exposes kernel-owned VMA/page accounting instead, so this is
#   intentionally not a reference-kernel invariant.

# Tests that only run under qemu. A test belongs here when it needs a writable,
# byte-exact root: the elfuse lane runs without a sysroot, and the macOS root is
# neither writable nor byte-exact.
#
# The filename tests need one for a second reason. They assert that names Linux
# keeps apart stay apart, which a case-folding volume is entitled to get wrong,
# so running them without a sysroot would not merely fail to set up, it would
# measure the host's naming rules instead of Linux's. Their elfuse-side coverage
# is the make-check sysroot lanes.

# Test suites.
#
# This is the full aarch64 unit-test surface: every tests/manifest.txt ("make
# check") binary except the handful that assert elfuse-internal implementation
# details with no meaningful counterpart on a real kernel (most of the EL1 shim
# fast-path suite -- test-shim-* and test-shim-cred-race, which probe elfuse's
# own shim_data block and identity cache; test-shim-futex-fast is the exception
# and does run here, because every assertion in it is plain Linux futex ABI that
# a real kernel adjudicates (unlike test-mremap-infra, which guards elfuse's
# guest-IPA infra reserve, and test-oom-proc, documented in its own header).
# test-mremap-tail-emfile is listed here as an elfuse-lane regression and marked
# QEMU_SKIP because its host-reserve assertion has no Linux analogue. There is
# no "core" vs "extended" split here; everything below runs in both
# elfuse-aarch64 and qemu-aarch64 modes, and genuine, understood divergences
# from the qemu reference kernel are called out via QEMU_SKIP with a comment
# rather than silently dropped from this list. The unit lane runs binaries this
# repo builds, not fixtures it downloads, so an empty build/ is a setup mistake
# rather than a run to report on. Without this every test fails on a missing
# file and the summary reads like a hundred-odd regressions; "make clean"
# followed by "make elfuse" is enough to produce it, because elfuse alone does
# not build the test binaries. Name the cause once and stop, the way driver.sh
# does with ALLOW_MISSING_BINARIES.

# elfuse-x86_64 baseline (71) is the sum of the seven Rosetta sub-suites in
# run_rosetta_x86_64_suites:
#   test-rosetta-cli.sh            = 4
#   test-rosetta-failure-modes.sh  = 3
#   test-rosetta-statics.sh        = 20
#   test-rosetta-alpine.sh         = 33
#   test-rosetta-audit.sh          = 2
#   test-rosetta-jit.sh            = 2
#   test-rosetta-glibc.sh          = 7
# The full per-binary inventory and the per-host capture process live in
# docs/testing.md "x86_64 Acceptance Inventory and Per-Host Baselines". Bump
# these counts in the same commit that grows or trims any sub-suite's Results
# line so the matrix gate stays in sync.
#
# Per-mode baseline gate. Encoded as "key|min_pass|max_fail" tuples in a
# single indexed array so stock macOS bash 3.2 (which lacks 'declare -A') works
# the same as bash 4+.
#
# The bareword-subscript hazard the prior 'declare -A' form had to dodge (shfmt
# rewriting [a-b] into [a - b] inside subscripts) does not apply to this
# encoding: keys live inside a quoted string, never as a subscript expression.
#
# Order: aarch64 baselines first, then x86_64 baselines keyed by detected host
# SoC class. The two M-series classes diverge inside sys_mmap_fixed_high_va on
# IPA width (apple-m1-m2 is 36-bit, the overflow-segment path; apple-m3-plus is
# 40-bit, the bisected-slab path on M5). The seven Rosetta sub-suites currently
# emit fixed pass counts regardless of IPA width, so both rows start at 71; an
# operator with M3+ hardware updates the apple-m3-plus row in place when their
# observed counts diverge. apple-unknown is the fallback row for SoC strings the
# detector does not recognize yet.
#
# These are floors, not observed totals: a run with every fixture present passes
# far more (271 on the machine that last raised this row), and the gap is the
# suites that skip without their fixtures. Raise a row only for a test that runs
# without fixtures, by the amount it adds.
#
# elfuse-aarch64 went 243 to 247 for test-shim-futex-fast, test-futex-wake-op,
# test-futex-wake-nowaiter and test-futex-requeue-account, then 247 to 250 for
# test-signal-in-shim, test-ptrace-interrupt and test-futex-timed. All seven are
# built from tests/, so they run in any checkout, and all seven are invoked
# here: test-ptrace-interrupt was credited in this count before it was, which
# made the floor one higher than the lanes could reach on a checkout without
# fixtures. qemu-aarch64 runs test-futex-timed too. The other two are
# elfuse-internal, test-ptrace-interrupt by way of QEMU_SKIP since a ptrace-stop
# register snapshot has no counterpart there, so the qemu floor was 226; it
# stayed at 225 deliberately, because the qemu fixtures were not present on the
# machine that made those changes and 226 would have been a number nobody
# observed. A floor too low costs nothing; an unobserved one asserts a run that
# did not happen.
#
# Both floors then went up by one for test-futex-requeue-samebucket, which
# regression-tests FUTEX_REQUEUE(X, X): no fixture, not in QEMU_SKIP, so it runs
# in both lanes. elfuse-aarch64 251 and qemu-aarch64 226 were both observed
# there (285 and 263 respectively, fixtures present), unlike the 225 above.
#
# Both went up by one again for test-futex-wake-pi, which regression-tests the
# EINVAL a plain wake owes a PI waiter, and which runs in both lanes for the
# same two reasons. 252 and 227, observed here at 286 and 264.
