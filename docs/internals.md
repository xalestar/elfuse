# elfuse Internals

This document is the canonical technical reference for the runtime. It maps the
source tree, then walks each subsystem from guest entry to syscall return:
memory layout, the EL1 shim and HVC protocol, page-table management, syscall
translation, threads, fork/clone, signals, ptrace, dynamic linking, and the
GDB stub.

It is aimed at contributors. For a high-level overview see
[../README.md](../README.md); for command-line use see [usage.md](usage.md);
for the validation flow see [testing.md](testing.md).

## Runtime Model

`elfuse` runs one Linux guest process inside one Hypervisor.framework VM owned
by one macOS host process. Guest code executes at EL0. A small EL1 shim
(`src/core/shim.S`) handles exceptions, provides the syscall trap path, and
cooperates with the host through a compact HVC protocol.

aarch64 guests execute their own instructions natively on the CPU.
x86_64 guests (both static and dynamic) execute through Apple's
Rosetta translator hosted inside the same VM at link address
`0x800000000000` (see [x86_64-via-Apple-Rosetta](#x86_64-via-apple-rosetta)).
Both architectures share the same EL1 shim, syscall surface, and
host-side handlers.

### Lifecycle In Five Steps

The whole runtime fits into a load -> boot -> run -> translate ->
return loop:

1. Load. `src/main.c` parses options; `src/core/elf.c` parses the
   guest ELF and any `PT_INTERP`; `src/core/guest.c` reserves a
   demand-paged guest address space (up to 1 TiB IPA on M3+); the
   initial Linux stack is built by `src/core/stack.c`.
2. Boot. `src/core/bootstrap.c` installs the EL1 shim
   (`src/core/shim.S`) in the runtime infrastructure reserve, seeds
   page tables, and enters EL0. For x86_64 guests, Rosetta is loaded
   alongside as a co-resident aarch64 binary at `0x800000000000`.
3. Run. The guest executes natively on an HVF vCPU. Pure computation
   never leaves the guest.
4. Translate. A guest `SVC #0` traps into the shim and is forwarded
   over `HVC #5` to the host. `src/syscall/syscall.c` dispatches into
   focused domain handlers (`mem.c`, `fs.c`, `net.c`, `signal.c`, ...)
   that translate errno values, flag layouts, struct shapes, and
   socket address formats between Linux and macOS.
5. Return. The host writes the result back into the vCPU, signals any
   required TLBI (see [Dynamic Page-Table Extension And
   TLBI](#dynamic-page-table-extension-and-tlbi)), and the shim
   `ERET`s back to EL0.

Threads enter the same loop on their own vCPU
(`src/runtime/thread.c`). `fork` clones the loop in a new
`posix_spawn`-ed `elfuse` process and transfers state through IPC
(`src/runtime/forkipc.c`). `execve` reloads the ELF inside the
existing VM and restarts the loop (`src/syscall/exec.c`).

Boot sequence:

1. `src/main.c` parses options and prepares guest bootstrap state.
2. `src/core/elf.c` parses the ELF image and any `PT_INTERP` interpreter.
3. `src/core/stack.c` builds a Linux-style initial stack (`argc`, `argv`,
   `envp`, `auxv`).
4. `src/core/guest.c` reserves guest memory, page tables, and semantic
   regions.
5. `src/core/shim.S` enters guest EL0 and forwards traps through HVC exits.
6. `src/syscall/syscall.c` dispatches Linux syscalls into domain handlers.
7. `src/syscall/proc.c` owns the main vCPU run loop and stop/exit
   integration.

## Generic Dynamic Containers

`src/utils.h` provides the raw `dynamic_array_t` used by the procfs VMA
snapshot and the string builder. It is header-only: every operation is a
`static inline`, so there is no container object to link. Capacity
is measured in element slots, while `count` is the number of logical elements.
The allocation is one contiguous block of `capacity * element_size` bytes;
both the count addition and the multiplication are checked before a growth.
Arithmetic overflow reports `EOVERFLOW`, invalid arguments report `EINVAL`,
and an allocation failure reports `ENOMEM`. Growth is transactional: on any
failure the old pointer, count, and capacity remain valid.

The generated typed facades own only their array storage. Elements are copied
as trivially-copyable bytes, so the container does not call destructors and
does not manage pointers or other resources held by an element. `destroy`
frees the contiguous block and restores the zero state. A facade can therefore
be declared as `{0}` and initialized lazily on its first operation.

`string_builder_t` wraps a raw `dynamic_array_t` of `char`. The count is the
C-string length and excludes the terminator, so every path that grows the
builder reserves one byte beyond the payload and restores `data[count] ==
'\0'`. The surviving surface is `init`, `destroy`, `length`, `data_const`,
`append_n`, and `appendf`; the plain-text `append`, `reserve`, and the capacity accessor went
with the header-only conversion because nothing outside the tests used them.
`appendf` renders into a scratch buffer before touching storage, which is what
makes a format string or argument aliasing the builder's own data safe, and it
commits only the prefix through the first NUL, matching standard C string
semantics.

## Hypervisor.framework Constraints

Apple HVF imposes a handful of constraints that shape the rest of the design:

- W^X is enforced even with `SCTLR.WXN=0`. A page-table entry cannot be both
  writable and executable. Use RW for data and RX for code.
- HVF returns `SCTLR=0x0` by default; `RES1` bits must be set explicitly. The
  shim uses `SCTLR_RES1` (`0x30D00980`) plus the desired bits.
- The MMU must be enabled from inside the vCPU (via HVC #4 from the shim),
  not by the host before `hv_vcpu_run()`. Setting `SCTLR.M=1` from the host
  before vCPU entry causes permission faults on the first instruction fetch.
- `GUEST_IPA_BASE` must be `0`. ELF binaries use absolute addresses from
  their link address (e.g., `0x400000`); a non-zero IPA base produces
  translation faults.
- System registers cannot be set via `MSR` from the guest because
  `HCR_EL2.TSC=1` traps all `MSR` writes. Boot-time sysreg installation
  (RES1 bits, MMU enable, TTBR0, etc.) goes through HVC #4 from the EL1
  shim. Runtime EL0 sysreg traps -- `MSR TPIDR_EL0` and similar -- are
  handled by the HVC #12 system-instruction trap path.
- Only `HV_SYS_REG_*` constants from Hypervisor.framework may be used for
  register IDs.
- `hv_vcpu_t` value zero is a valid handle (normally the first vCPU in a VM),
  not an invalid sentinel. `guest_t` and `thread_entry_t` therefore track
  handle ownership with a separate `vcpu_valid` flag; signal preemption,
  quiesce, ptrace, and teardown must consult that flag before calling HVF.
- Cross-thread vCPU register access is unreliable; all register access must
  happen on the owning thread. This drives the snapshot protocol used by
  both ptrace and the GDB stub.
- HVF allows only one VM per host process. This is the reason `fork` is
  implemented through `posix_spawn` plus IPC state transfer.

## Memory Layout

Guest memory is identity-mapped (guest VA == guest IPA). Large areas use 2 MiB
block descriptors by default; mappings that need mixed permissions are split
to 4 KiB L3 pages (see [Page Table Splitting](#page-table-splitting)).

Low, fixed addresses:

```
0x00400000   - varies:       ELF LOAD segments (PIE_LOAD_BASE for ET_DYN)
0x01000000:                  brk base (16 MiB)
0x07800000   - 0x07800FFF:   Stack guard page (PROT_NONE, dynamic position)
0x07801000   - 0x07FFFFFF:   Stack (8 MiB, 4 x 2 MiB blocks, RW, grows down)
0x10000000   - 0x101FFFFF:   mmap RX region (initial 2 MiB, pre-mapped RX)
0x10200000   - mmap_limit:   mmap RX growth area
0x000200000000 - 0x0002001FFFFF: mmap RW region (initial 2 MiB at 8 GiB, RW)
0x000200200000 - mmap_limit:     mmap RW growth area
```

Within-32-bit values are rendered with 8-digit padding; values that
extend above 32 bits use 12-digit padding so a reader can tell the
range class at a glance.

High addresses, anchored to `interp_base` (computed from `guest_size`, see
below). The runtime infrastructure reserve is a 16 MiB region placed at
`[interp_base - INFRA_RESERVE, interp_base)` -- in the dead zone above
`mmap_limit` -- so guest binaries keep the low addresses their link scripts
expect. It is present regardless of `--sysroot`; offsets are relative to its
base `infra = interp_base - 16 MiB` (exact values in `src/core/guest.h`):

```
infra + 0x000000 - 0x00FFFF:  null guard (64 KiB, unmapped)
infra + 0x010000 - 0xDF5FFF:  page table pool (~13.9 MiB, RW)
infra + 0xDF6000 - 0xDFFFFF:  shim code slot (40 KiB, RX). Shares the PT
                              pool's tail 2 MiB L2 block, so that block
                              splits to 4 KiB L3 pages (mixed RX/RW).
infra + 0xE00000 - 0xFFFFFF:  shim data + EL1 stack (2 MiB L2 block, RW;
                              ends at interp_base)
interp_base      - varies:    Dynamic linker (g->interp_base, --sysroot only)
```

The reserve is demand-paged (`MAP_ANON`), so its unused page-table-pool pages
cost no host RAM despite the generous virtual reservation. The pool holds
~3558 L3 pages (~7 GiB of split address space), enough for the many V8
isolates a Node `worker_threads` pool or cluster spins up.

The guest size is determined by the VM's configured IPA width (capped at
40-bit / 1 TiB):

- 36-bit IPA (64 GiB) -- native AArch64 on Apple M2: `mmap_limit ≈ 56 GiB`,
  `interp_base ≈ 60 GiB`
- 40-bit IPA (1 TiB) -- native AArch64 on Apple M3 and later:
  `mmap_limit ≈ 1016 GiB`, `interp_base ≈ 1020 GiB`

Both `mmap_limit` and `interp_base` are computed at runtime from `guest_size`
and stored in `guest_t`. macOS demand-pages physical memory on first touch,
so the reservation costs no RAM until the guest writes to a page.

The mmap RW region starts at 8 GiB to match real Linux kernel address-space
layout, where `mmap` allocations sit well above text/data/brk.

For address spaces larger than 512 GiB, the L0 page table needs multiple
entries (each covers 512 GiB). The page-table builders compute the L0 index
from the actual IPA and allocate L1 tables on demand per L0 slot.

## Page Table Splitting

A 2 MiB L2 block descriptor cannot mix RW and RX permissions, but real shared
libraries combine `.text` (RX) and `.data` (RW) within a single 2 MiB range.
`guest_split_block()` in `src/core/guest.c` converts an L2 block descriptor
into a table descriptor pointing to an L3 table of 512 × 4 KiB page entries,
each with independent permissions.

Splitting is triggered by:

- `sys_mmap` with `MAP_FIXED`, when the fixed address lands in a block whose
  permissions differ from the request (typical case: the dynamic linker
  overlaying `.data` RW onto a library `.text` RX block).
- `sys_mprotect`, when changing permissions for a sub-block range, e.g.
  RELRO finalization.

`guest_update_perms()` orchestrates the full workflow: it checks whether a
block needs splitting, splits it if so, then updates the affected L3 page
entries. Whole-block permission changes are done in place without splitting.

`mmap` itself uses a gap-finding allocator that walks the sorted region array
to find free address space. `PROT_EXEC` requests go to the RX region
(`MMAP_RX_BASE = 0x10000000`); other requests go to the RW region
(`MMAP_BASE = 0x200000000`). Address hints are honored when possible. This
arrangement makes `.text` and `.data` land in different 2 MiB blocks where
practical, and L3 splitting handles the residual cases where they share a
block.

## Dynamic Page-Table Extension And TLBI

When `sys_mmap` or `sys_brk` needs memory beyond the currently mapped page
tables, the host calls `guest_extend_page_tables()` to add new L2 entries.
This is safe because the vCPU is paused while servicing HVC #5. The host
accumulates the smallest sufficient TLBI request into a per-vCPU
`_Thread_local cpu_tlbi_req` slot (see `src/core/guest.h`) and translates
it into `X8`, `X9`, `X10`, and `X11` on return from HVC #5:

```
X8 == 0  TLBI_NONE        no flush; restore GPRs (keep X0); ERET
X8 == 1  TLBI_BROADCAST   TLBI VMALLE1IS + DSB ISH + ISB
                          -> restore GPRs (keep X0); ERET
X8 == 2  drop-frame       discard the saved GPR frame
                          (`add sp, sp, #256`) and ERET on the rebuilt
                          EL0 register state, reloading only `X8` from
                          the frame's own slot (`[sp, #64]`), since the
                          marker occupies that register. Set by
                          `rt_sigreturn` (which writes the whole
                          register set directly into the vCPU) and by
                          signal delivery on the syscall-return path
                          (so handler PC/SP/LR/args installed by the
                          host are not overwritten by the stale shim
                          frame on ERET). Always issues `IC IALLU`.
X8 == 3  TLBI_RANGE       loop TLBI VAE1IS over `X9` (start VA),
                          `X10` (page count); 4 KiB granule. Used for
                          up to `TLBI_SELECTIVE_MAX_PAGES = 16` pages.
X8 == 4  TLBI_RANGE_LARGE single-shot TLBI RVAE1IS with the encoded
                          operand in `X9`. Used for 17..64 pages when
                          `FEAT_TLBIRANGE` is available
                          (`g_tlbi_range_supported`). Above 64 pages,
                          or when the feature is absent, the host
                          upgrades to broadcast (`X8 == 1`).
X11      icache hint      Set to `1` when the request transitions a
                          page to executable (W^X swap); the shim then
                          issues an `IC` invalidate alongside the
                          chosen TLBI flavor.
```

`TLBI VAE1IS` retires any 2 MiB block entry containing the VA
(ARM ARM B2.2.5.6), so `guest_split_block()` callers no longer issue a
separate broadcast after the split lands.

`X8 == 2` is the generic drop-saved-frame marker: the host has
rebuilt EL0 register state directly into the vCPU and the saved
syscall frame on the EL1 stack is stale, so the shim drops the frame
and `ERET`s without restoring GPRs. Two call sites write it, both in
`src/syscall/signal.c`:

- `signal_rt_sigreturn`, after restoring the saved sigframe.
- `deliver_signal_locked`, when a signal is delivered on the
  syscall-return path; without the marker the shim would overwrite the
  handler PC, SP, LR, and arg-register state with the stale syscall
  frame on `ERET`.

`sys_execve` writes no marker: it re-enters through the shim's MMU-off
`_start`, which pops no frame. The `HVC #5` epilogue and both `HVC #9`
W^X tails branch to `exec_drop_frame` on the marker; `handle_brk`
(`HVC #10`) drops its frame on every return.

Linux preserves `X1`-`X30` across `SVC #0`, so the marker must not reach
EL0: a resumed `SVC` that has not executed yet would run as syscall 2.
Those tails therefore reload `X8` from the frame's `X8` slot before the
pop. The slot holds the `X8` the exception was taken with unless the
host published another there:
`signal_rt_sigreturn` publishes the one it restored, and the `BRK`
ptrace stop the one its tracer left. `signal_rt_sigreturn` also parks
that value for a signal delivered later in the same epilogue, which
would otherwise snapshot the marker as the guest's `X8`; the run loop
drops the record before every `hv_vcpu_run()`, and an inline ptrace
stop that moves the PC re-keys it. The TLBI kinds on the ordinary
syscall-return tail are not covered: a signal delivered there still
records the wire values as `X8`-`X11`.

Important: `signal_rt_sigreturn` returns `SYSCALL_EXEC_HAPPENED` to
bypass the normal syscall dispatch epilogue, as `sys_execve` does.
`deliver_signal_locked` runs from inside the epilogue. Any future code
path that rebuilds EL0 register state on the syscall-return path must
write `X8 = 2` the same way, and publish the guest's `X8` if it differs
from the one the frame was entered with.

## EL1 Shim And HVC Protocol

Vectors enter EL1 from EL0 traps and forward them to the host through HVC.
DC ZVA is emulated inside the shim (it zeroes 64 bytes at the cache-line-
aligned address from the `Rt` register); HVF traps DC ZVA via `HCR_EL2.TDZ=1`.

| HVC # | Purpose | Registers |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| #0 | Normal exit | `X0` = exit code |
| #2 | Bad exception | `X0`=ESR, `X1`=FAR, `X2`=ELR, `X3`=SPSR, `X5`=vector |
| #4 | Set boot system register | `X0` = reg ID (0–8), `X1` = value (used by the shim during boot to install RES1 bits and enable the MMU) |
| #5 | Syscall forward | `X0`–`X5` = args, `X8` = syscall number on entry; on return `X8` carries the TLBI kind (`0` = none, `1` = broadcast, `3` = selective range with `X9` = VA + `X10` = page count, `4` = single-shot `TLBI RVAE1IS` with encoded operand in `X9`). `X8 = 2` is the generic drop-saved-frame marker -- set when the host has rebuilt EL0 state directly (by `rt_sigreturn` and by signal delivery on the syscall-return path) so the shim discards the saved syscall frame on ERET, reloading only `X8` from it. `X11` is the icache-flush hint (set to `1` when the request transitions a page to executable, so the shim issues `IC` alongside the chosen TLBI) |
| #6 | Embedder extension | `X8` = call number, `X0`–`X7` = args; routed to `g->hvc6_handler` if set, no-op otherwise. Handler may request a vCPU yield via `proc_request_hvc6_yield()` |
| #7 | MRS trap (read sysreg) | host reads register from ESR ISS; returns value in `X0` |
| #9 | W^X toggle | `X0` = FAR, `X1` = type (0 = exec→RX, 1 = write→RW); on return `X8 = 2` when the host answered with a `SIGSEGV` delivery instead of a flip |
| #10 | BRK from EL0 | SIGTRAP delivery / ptrace-stop; GPRs in frame |
| #11 | EL0 fault | SIGSEGV/SIGILL delivery; GPRs in frame |
| #12 | EL0 system-instruction trap | cache maintenance logging (DC CVAU, IC IVAU, …) and `MSR TPIDR_EL0` emulation |
| #13 | Ptrace interrupt | the shim restores the saved SVC frame before this stop, so ptrace snapshots architectural registers |

### Critical Vector-Entry Rule

Vector entry stubs that lead to `svc_handler` MUST NOT clobber any GPR. The
Linux syscall ABI preserves all registers except `X0` across `SVC #0`, and
musl/glibc rely on this for scratch registers (`X9`–`X15`). If a vector entry
writes to any GPR (e.g., `mov x5, #offset`) before `svc_handler` saves
registers, the saved value is wrong and the EL0 caller's register state is
corrupted after `ERET`.

Only `bad_exception` vectors may clobber `X5` (they halt, so preservation is
unnecessary).

## Syscall Translation Boundary

Linux user-space compatibility comes from explicit translation at the syscall
boundary. `src/syscall/syscall.c` routes syscall numbers into focused domain
files. The translation layer is responsible for:

- errno translation
- flag translation
- Linux/macOS structure layout adaptation
- guest memory copying for pointer arguments
- Linux-compatible descriptor and signal semantics

### errno

macOS and Linux errno values diverge starting around 35. `linux_errno()` in
`src/syscall/translate.c` maps via switch. Notable mappings:

| Linux | macOS |
|-------|-------|
| `EAGAIN` (11) | `EAGAIN` (35) |
| `ENOSYS` (38) | `ENOSYS` (78) |
| `ENAMETOOLONG` (36) | `ENAMETOOLONG` (63) |
| `ELOOP` (40) | `ELOOP` (62) |

### `AT_*` Flags

`AT_*` flag bits differ between Linux and macOS:

| Flag | Linux | macOS |
|------|-------|-------|
| `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` | `0x100` | `0x20` |
| `AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW` | `0x400` | `0x40` |
| `AT_REMOVEDIR` | `0x200` | `0x80` |

Most `AT_*` flags go through `translate_at_flags()` in
`src/syscall/translate.c` before issuing macOS calls. `faccessat` is a
special case: Linux defines `AT_EACCESS` at the same bit (`0x200`) as
`AT_REMOVEDIR`, so `faccessat` paths instead use
`translate_faccessat_flags()` (also in `src/syscall/translate.c`), which
interprets that bit as `AT_EACCESS`.

### `open` Flag Values

Aarch64-Linux open flags differ from x86_64. From `asm-generic/fcntl.h`:

| Flag | Value (octal) | Value (hex) |
|------|---------------|-------------|

### Clock IDs

Linux `CLOCK_MONOTONIC = 1`, macOS `CLOCK_MONOTONIC = 6`. See
`translate_clockid()` in `src/syscall/time.c`. Other clock IDs are
translated similarly.

### Sockets

Socket syscalls are translated in `src/syscall/net.c` and friends:

- `AF_INET6` differs: Linux `10`, macOS `30`.
- `sockaddr` has no `sa_len` byte on Linux but does on macOS. All conversions
  go through `linux_to_mac_sockaddr()` and `mac_to_linux_sockaddr()`.
- Linux ORs `SOCK_NONBLOCK` (`0x800`) and `SOCK_CLOEXEC` (`0x80000`) into the
  type argument; both bits must be extracted before calling `socket()`.
- `SOL_SOCKET` option numbers (`SO_TYPE`, `SO_SNDBUF`, `SO_RCVBUF`, …)
  differ between platforms and are remapped per option.

Netlink sockets are emulated in `src/syscall/netlink.c`: `NETLINK_ROUTE`
answers the `RTM_GETLINK` / `RTM_GETADDR` dumps `getifaddrs` issues, and
`NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT` sockets are accepted as silent sockets -- no uevent
is ever synthesized, so the fd never becomes readable, which is exactly a
real Linux kernel with no hotplug activity -- because libusb-style hotplug
monitors must open, bind, and set `SO_PASSCRED` on one before they will
initialize at all.

`socket()` validates its type argument the way `__sock_create()` and
`netlink_create()` do, in that order: an unknown bit outside
`SOCK_NONBLOCK|SOCK_CLOEXEC` is `EINVAL`, and a base type other than
`SOCK_RAW` or `SOCK_DGRAM` is `ESOCKTNOSUPPORT` -- before the protocol
number is looked at, so `socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_STREAM, 99)` reports the
type error and not the family one.

`SOL_SOCKET` options on a netlink fd follow `sk_setsockopt` /
`sk_getsockopt` rather than being accepted and forgotten: whatever can be
set can be read back, `SO_RCVBUF` and `SO_SNDBUF` clamp-double-floor at the
two different `SOCK_MIN_*` floors, `SO_RCVTIMEO` really does bound a
blocking receive, and the options Linux refuses (`SO_SNDLOWAT`, a
privileged `SO_DEBUG`, a non-inet `SO_REUSEPORT`, a short `SO_LINGER` or
timeout `optlen`) are refused with the same errno.

`SO_RCVTIMEO` and `SO_SNDTIMEO` are stored as `sk_rcvtimeo` /
`sk_sndtimeo` are: a jiffy count with `HZ` pinned at 1000, which gives
`sock_set_timeout()`'s three states rather than two. `{0, 0}` and any
`tv_sec` past `MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT/HZ - 1` mean wait forever; a negative
`tv_sec` means do not wait at all, so a blocking receive under it reports
`EAGAIN` at once; anything else is that many milliseconds, rounded up from
a sub-jiffy `tv_usec`. Both of the first two read back as `{0, 0}`, exactly
as `sock_get_timeout()` reports them, so only a receive can tell them
apart. The deadline such a timeout produces is added to the clock with
saturation, since the largest one Linux accepts is within seconds of
overflowing a 64-bit millisecond count.

An interrupted receive with a finite timeout forbids the SVC restart only
when the interruption is one the guest can see. `io_wait_fd_timed_or_-
interrupted()` also reports `EINTR` for the dispatcher's own execve
handoff, which no signal accompanies; forbidding there turned a sibling's
`execve` into an `EINTR` on a `recvmsg`. The restarted call instead resumes
the deadline the interrupted attempt was using, which is what Linux's
`restart_block` carries.

`SOL_NETLINK` is emulated under the same contract `bind()` gives -- the
membership and the flags are recorded, and no multicast traffic is ever
synthesized to deliver on them. `NETLINK_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` /
`NETLINK_DROP_MEMBERSHIP` range-check the group and return 0;
`NETLINK_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS` reads the resulting bitmap back;
`NETLINK_PKTINFO`, `NETLINK_BROADCAST_ERROR`, `NETLINK_NO_ENOBUFS`,
`NETLINK_CAP_ACK`, `NETLINK_EXT_ACK` and `NETLINK_GET_STRICT_CHK` set and
read back as flags (a libnl or libmnl monitor sets several of these on the
way up and treats a refusal as a broken socket); `NETLINK_LISTEN_ALL_NSID`
wants `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and reports `EPERM`; the removed mmap ring options
and anything else report `ENOPROTOOPT`.

Netlink socket state is keyed by guest fd number, and a guest fd number
outlives its socket: `fd_cleanup_entry()` runs the netlink teardown after
the number is already back in the fd table's free pool, so a concurrent
`socket()` can be handed it while the previous slot is still live. Slots
therefore carry an allocation generation -- lookups answer with the newest
slot for a number and teardown retires the oldest -- which pairs each
teardown with the socket that asked for it whatever order the threads
arrive in.

### Stack Alignment

The Linux initial stack must have `SP` 16-byte aligned and pointing directly
at `argc`. Total 8-byte words on the structured area are
`35 + extra + argc + envc`, where:

- `35` covers the fixed scaffolding: 15 base auxv entries (`30` words) +
  the `AT_NULL` auxv terminator (`2` words) + the `envp` `NULL`
  terminator (`1`) + the `argv` `NULL` terminator (`1`) + `argc` itself
  (`1`) = `35`.
- `extra` starts at `4` because `AT_EXECFN` and `AT_BASE` are always
  emitted (`+2` words each). It adds another `2` for `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR`
  when a vDSO is present, and another `2` for `AT_EXECFD` when
  `binfmt_misc` passes one.
- `argc` and `envc` are the user-provided argument and environment counts.

If that total is odd, one padding word is pushed before `auxv`. Padding
goes above the structured area, never below. Post-push masking
(`sp &= ~15`) breaks because it inserts a gap between `SP` and `argc`. See
`build_linux_stack()` in `src/core/stack.c` for the full layout.

### `mmap` Notes

Aligned file-backed `MAP_SHARED` (fixed or non-fixed) installs a real
host `mmap(MAP_FIXED|MAP_SHARED, fd)` overlay onto the guest slab so
the kernel page cache keeps the mapping coherent with the file (and
with peer overlays). The slab is tracked as a sorted list of
2 MiB-aligned `hvf_segment_t` entries; each overlay request splits,
unmaps, and re-`mmap`s the host file at the exact host VA, then
re-maps the segment. Apple Silicon enforces 16 KiB host pages, so the
gap-finder advances to the next host-page boundary after each
allocation.

The snapshot `pread` emulation (zero first for pages beyond EOF, then
overlay file content) is the fallback for the cases where the overlay
path cannot be used: misaligned `MAP_FIXED`, `MAP_PRIVATE` file-backed
mappings, and any time the host slab cannot accept a fresh overlay at
the requested VA.

`MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS` is promoted before fork to a memfd-style
overlay (`mmap_fork_prepare_anon_shared`) and reattached in the child
via `SCM_RIGHTS` (`mmap_fork_restore_overlays`), so cross-fork shared
anonymous memory stays coherent. Both promotion and overlay are
disabled for Rosetta because HVF caches host VA-to-PA at `hv_vm_map`
time. Validation: `tests/test-msync.c`,
`tests/test-cross-fork-mapshared.c`.

## Threads And Futexes

Guest threads map 1:1 to host pthreads. Each guest thread owns one vCPU and
shares the same guest address space. HVF supports multiple vCPUs per VM,
each bound to the host thread that created it; multiple vCPUs share guest
physical memory via `hv_vm_map()`. Up to `MAX_THREADS = 64` guest threads
are supported per VM.

### Thread Table

`src/runtime/thread.c` and `thread.h`:

- `thread_entry_t` per thread holds the vCPU handle plus its explicit validity,
  host pthread, per-thread signal mask, `clear_child_tid` (for
  `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID`), and the thread's `SP_EL1` exception stack.
- `_Thread_local current_thread` gives O(1) access from syscall handlers.
- Each thread receives a 4 KiB EL1 exception stack carved out of the shim
  data region.

### Futex

`src/runtime/futex.c` implements:

- The classic ops: `FUTEX_WAIT`, `FUTEX_WAKE`, `FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET`,
  `FUTEX_WAKE_BITSET`, `FUTEX_REQUEUE`, `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE`, `FUTEX_WAKE_OP`.
- A subset of priority-inheritance ops: `FUTEX_LOCK_PI`, `FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI`,
  `FUTEX_TRYLOCK_PI`. Priority semantics are not actually inherited -- the
  ops behave as ordinary mutex acquire/release, which is enough for glibc
  and musl to make forward progress.
- `futex_waitv` (syscall 449) for batch waits across up to 128 futex
  addresses.
- Robust-list cleanup: `set_robust_list` / `get_robust_list` are wired up
  in `src/syscall/syscall.c`, and `robust_list_walk()` releases owned
  futexes on thread exit, marking them `FUTEX_OWNER_DIED`.

Wait queues live in a hash table keyed by guest virtual address, with a
per-bucket mutex. Each waiter has its own condition variable for precise
wakeup. Thread exit calls `futex_wake_one()` on `clear_child_tid`, which is
how `pthread_join()` waits via the TID address.

Atomicity: the bucket mutex is held across the futex word read and the
waiter enqueue, so the compare-and-wait is a single critical section.

### Lock Map

| Resource | Lock | File |
|----------|------|------|
| `mmap`/`brk` allocators + page tables | `mmap_lock` (order 1) | `src/syscall/mem.c` |
| FD table | `fd_lock` (order 3) | `src/syscall/fdtable.c` |
| Special FDs (timerfd, eventfd, signalfd) | `sfd_lock` (order 5a) | `src/syscall/fd.c` |
| Thread table | `pthread_mutex` | `src/runtime/thread.c` |
| Futex wait queues | `pthread_mutex` (per bucket) | `src/runtime/futex.c` |
| FUSE (sessions, file/dir state) | global `fuse_lock` + per-session `session->lock` | `src/syscall/fuse.c` |
| Sysroot snapshot | `pthread_mutex` | `src/syscall/proc-state.c` |
| Synthetic USB tree (scratch dirs + device model) | `usb_lock` (leaf) | `src/runtime/usb-sysfs.c` |
| usbdevfs fd side table | `usbdev_table_lock` + per-entry lock | `src/syscall/usbdev.c` |
| usbdevfs event-thread startup (runloop + notify port) | `usbdev_loop_lock` (leaf) | `src/syscall/usbdev.c` |
| Pipe buffer rings, and every close of a ring state file | `pipe_ring_lock` (leaf) | `src/syscall/pipe-ring.c` |

Lock ordering is documented inline in those files
(`mmap_lock` is order 1, `fd_lock` is order 3, `sfd_lock` is order 5a)
so callers that need multiple locks acquire them in the right sequence.
See the lock-ordering comment block in `src/syscall/internal.h` for the
authoritative list.

Page-table consistency is preserved by the `mmap_lock` plus TLB broadcasts
via `TLBI VMALLE1IS` from any vCPU; hardware coherency is verified by
`tests/test-multi-vcpu`.

### Thread Group Exit

`exit_group` sets a global `exit_group_requested` flag, calls
`thread_for_each(thread_force_exit_cb)` which invokes `hv_vcpus_exit()` on
all worker vCPUs to break them out of `hv_vcpu_run()`, and joins worker
threads with a timeout so `CLEARTID` cleanup can complete.

### Not Implemented

- True priority inheritance for the PI futex ops. The ops are wired up but
  behave as ordinary mutexes; this matches what glibc and musl need for
  forward progress, not real RT scheduling.
- CPU affinity (`sched_setaffinity`) returns the all-CPUs mask.

## Fork, Clone, And `execve`

macOS HVF allows only one VM per process, so process-style `fork` cannot
clone the live VM. `elfuse` implements it through `posix_spawn` plus IPC
state transfer:

1. Parent creates a `socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)`.
2. Parent `posix_spawn`s a new `elfuse --fork-child <fd>` process.
3. Parent serializes VM state over IPC (see paths below).
4. Child receives state, creates its own VM, restores registers directly
   into EL0 (bypassing the shim `_start` so callee-saved GPRs survive), and
   enters the vCPU loop with `X0 = 0` (the child return from `clone`).
5. Before spawning, the parent allocates a namespace-wide guest PID and
   reserves both a local process-table slot and shared lifecycle entry. After
   IPC succeeds it commits the child's host PID, releases the child into guest
   code, and returns the child PID. Allocation or admission failure returns
   `EAGAIN` without allowing an untracked child to run.

### Process Lifecycle And Guest PID 1

The first guest process in an elfuse invocation has guest PID 1 and therefore
becomes the fallback parent for orphaned descendants when no living child
subreaper is closer. elfuse does not insert a hidden init process and does not
automatically discard an adopted child's exit status merely because its new
parent is PID 1. As on Linux, the new parent must consume that status with a
`wait*()` call, or explicitly select no-zombie semantics with
`SIGCHLD = SIG_IGN` or `SA_NOCLDWAIT`.

The invocation-scoped lifecycle registry keeps the Linux wait-format terminal
status (including signal and core-dump bits) and the exiting process's resource
usage until the new parent consumes it. A parent already blocked in `wait*()`
periodically imports newly adopted descendants; adoption of an already exited
child also sends `SIGCHLD` to wake the adopter. Both the per-process wait table
and the invocation-wide lifecycle registry grow geometrically with the actual
fork-family population; the on-disk registry serializes only its live records.
An empty newly created registry is initialized on first use; a nonempty record
set that cannot be read or validated fails closed instead of being overwritten
as empty. Fork admission is reserved before the host helper starts, so
allocation or registry failure fails the new fork instead of silently dropping
a waitable child. Pre-spawn registry reservations are not imported as adopted
children, and a matching local reserved slot remains authoritative through the
registry-publish/local-commit window.

An application runtime used directly as guest PID 1 may not perform that
reaper role. In that case, adopted terminal statuses remain in elfuse's
invocation-scoped lifecycle registry, and a direct macOS child of the PID 1
elfuse process may also remain a host zombie until the guest waits, changes its
SIGCHLD disposition, or exits. Guest waitability and host-process cleanup are
separate concerns: a future host-only reaper could collect the macOS process
while retaining its exit status for a later guest wait, but no such background
reaper is currently provided.

### CoW Fork Path

When `g->shm_fd >= 0` the guest memory is file-backed (`mkstemp` +
`unlink`, `MAP_SHARED`). Fork takes an APFS `fclonefileat` snapshot of
the backing file and sends the snapshot fd over `SCM_RIGHTS`:

- The snapshot decouples the parent and child: subsequent parent writes
  cannot be observed by the child even before the child remaps. APFS
  copy-on-write keeps the snapshot cheap.
- Parent stays on `MAP_SHARED` and does NOT remap -- HVF caches the host
  VA->PA mapping from `hv_vm_map`, and a `MAP_FIXED` remap does not
  update Stage-2, so a remapping parent would observe stale pages.
- Child maps the snapshot fd `MAP_PRIVATE`, producing an instant CoW
  clone with zero data copy.
- The IPC header sets `has_shm = 1` and `num_regions = 0`, skipping memory
  serialization entirely.
- Child calls `guest_init_from_shm()` instead of `guest_init()`, and must
  restore `g->ttbr0` from the IPC header -- `guest_init_from_shm` zeroes
  the struct, and without `ttbr0` page-table walks fail for all high VAs.
- `MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS` regions are promoted to a memfd-style
  overlay before fork (`mmap_fork_prepare_anon_shared`) and reattached in
  the child via SCM_RIGHTS (`mmap_fork_restore_overlays`) so cross-fork
  shared-memory coherence is preserved.

This path is roughly 50x faster than the legacy IPC copy path on large
guest memories.

The CoW path is disabled when hosting Rosetta because HVF caches the host
VA->PA mapping from `hv_vm_map`, and Rosetta's translated code touches
the parent's slab in ways the snapshot model cannot intercept. Rosetta
forks fall back to the legacy IPC copy path.

macOS rejects `MAP_PRIVATE` on `shm_open` fds (`EINVAL`), so the backing
file is created via `mkstemp` + `unlink`.

### Legacy IPC Copy Path

When `g->shm_fd < 0`, the parent serializes used memory regions in 1 MiB
chunks over the socket pair, the child calls `guest_init()` and receives the
data into fresh guest memory. CLOEXEC semantics follow POSIX: all FDs
(including those marked CLOEXEC) are inherited across `fork`. CLOEXEC takes
effect at `execve` (see `src/syscall/exec.c` step 4).

### `clone(CLONE_VM)`

`sys_clone_vm()` in `src/runtime/forkipc.c` handles `CLONE_VM` without
`CLONE_THREAD`. Unlike `sys_clone_thread()`, VM-clone children are waitable
via `wait4` and have exit semantics (`exit_signal`, `vm_exit_status`).
Unlike the `posix_spawn` fork path, they share the same `guest_t*`, the
same guest memory, and the same page tables.

### `clone(CLONE_THREAD)`

In `src/runtime/forkipc.c`:

1. `hv_vcpu_create()` and per-thread `SP_EL1` allocation.
2. Set the child SP, `TPIDR_EL0` (TLS), and copy the parent's signal mask.
3. `pthread_create()` running `vcpu_run_loop()` for the child vCPU.
4. Return the child TID to the parent; the child runs with `X0 = 0`.

### `execve`

`sys_execve` in `src/syscall/exec.c` reloads the ELF, resolves the dynamic
interpreter for dynamically-linked targets through `path_translate_at()`
like any other guest path, rebuilds page tables,
and restarts the vCPU. Signal handlers are reset to `SIG_DFL` per POSIX:
`SIG_IGN` stays `SIG_IGN`, and pending and blocked masks are preserved.
This happens in `signal_reset_for_exec()` after `guest_reset`.

## Signals

Signals are fully implemented in `src/syscall/signal.c`. The signal frame
matches Linux `arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:setup_rt_frame()` so the C
library's `__restore_rt → rt_sigreturn` (syscall 139) restores state
correctly. Both musl and glibc use this mechanism.

Key points:

- `signal_deliver()` builds `linux_rt_sigframe_t` on the guest stack,
  redirects the vCPU PC to the handler, and sets `X0 = signum`,
  `X30 = sa_restorer`.
- `signal_rt_sigreturn()` restores all 31 GPRs, `SP`, `PC`, and `PSTATE`
  from the frame.
- SIGPIPE is queued automatically when `write`, `writev`, or `pwrite64`
  returns `EPIPE`.
- Guest `ITIMER_REAL` is emulated internally rather than being forwarded to
  host `setitimer`, because macOS shares `alarm()` and
  `setitimer(ITIMER_REAL)` as a single timer, and `elfuse` already needs
  `alarm()` for its per-iteration vCPU watchdog.
- `signal_check_timer()` is called from the vCPU loop after each syscall.
- After `SYSCALL_EXEC_HAPPENED`, the vCPU loop verifies that `ELR_EL1` is
  non-zero -- a defensive check against HVF register-sync bugs.
- Each `thread_entry_t` carries its own `blocked` mask. `rt_sigprocmask`
  operates on `current_thread->blocked`, and child threads inherit the
  parent's mask at clone time.

## Ptrace And `clone(CLONE_VM)` Tracing

`clone(CLONE_VM)` produces an inferior that shares guest memory; the tracer
attaches via `PTRACE_SEIZE`. `BRK` instructions trigger ptrace-stops, after
which the tracer reads and writes registers through the snapshot protocol.

### Operations

In `src/syscall/proc.c`:

- `PTRACE_SEIZE` -- attach without stopping; sets `ptraced = 1`.
- `PTRACE_CONT` -- resume the stopped tracee, optionally injecting a signal.
- `PTRACE_INTERRUPT` -- force the tracee into ptrace-stop via
  `hv_vcpus_exit()`. A stop taken on a syscall return whose tail restores the
  saved SVC frame goes through HVC #13, so ptrace snapshots the architectural
  GPR set rather than shim scratch. The tails that rebuild EL0 state instead
  (`X8 = 2`) already hold that set live, bar the `X8` the shim reloads from
  the saved frame, so the host stops on them directly;
  an `execve` re-entry leaves the stop owed for the new image's first
  syscall.
- `PTRACE_GETREGSET` / `PTRACE_SETREGSET` (`NT_PRSTATUS`) -- read or write
  the tracee's register snapshot. Writes are applied on resume.

### Snapshot Protocol

Cross-thread HVF register access is unreliable, so every actor uses a
snapshot:

1. Tracee snapshots its own vCPU registers into `ptrace_regs` before
   entering ptrace-stop.
2. `ptrace_stopped = 1` and the tracer is signaled via `ptrace_cond`.
3. Tracer reads and writes the snapshot via `GETREGSET` / `SETREGSET`.
4. Tracer issues `PTRACE_CONT`; the tracee clears `ptrace_stopped` and is
   signaled via `resume_cond`.
5. Tracee applies any dirty register changes back to the vCPU and resumes.

### `BRK` Flow

1. Guest executes `BRK` → shim forwards via HVC #10.
2. If `current_thread->ptraced`, the tracee calls
   `thread_ptrace_stop(SIGTRAP)`.
3. Snapshot, broadcast, wait, resume as above.
4. `wait4` returns `WIFSTOPPED(status)` with `WSTOPSIG == SIGTRAP` to the
   tracer.

### `wait4` Integration

`sys_wait4()` first checks for ptraced or VM-clone children via
`thread_ptrace_wait()` before falling through to the process table for
regular `fork` children, so ptrace-stops and VM-exit states are reported
without racing the regular wait path.

## Guest-Internal FUSE

`src/syscall/fuse.c` implements `/dev/fuse`, `mount(..., "fuse", ...)`,
and the minimal VFS dispatch entirely inside the guest VM. Guest libfuse
programs (sshfs, ntfs-3g, AppImage runtimes) run without macFUSE,
FUSE-T, or FSKit on the host.

Key shape:

- A global `fuse_lock` plus per-session locks. Sessions are refcounted,
  so in-flight reads and writes pin the lock against daemon exit.
- Per-fd alias bindings for `dup`, `dup3`, and `fcntl(F_DUPFD)`.
- Per-file `io_in_progress` plus `io_cond` serializes `read` and
  `getdents64` against the offset field (matching Linux `f_pos_lock`).
  `lseek` waits on `io_in_progress`; `pread` skips it.
- Synchronous `FUSE_INIT` in `sys_mount`; negative `hdr.error`
  propagates back. Mount tombstones on daemon death and surfaces
  `-ENOTCONN`.
- `O_PATH` support, NAME_MAX-bounded `getdents64`, 8 MiB
  `FUSE_FRAME_CAP` on daemon writes, and procfs integration
  (`/proc/{mounts,filesystems,self/mountinfo}`).
- `fuse_materialize_path` so `execve` can load FUSE-backed binaries.
- The wait path honors `SA_RESTART` and ignored signals via the
  `signal_pending_interruption(restart_out)` helper.

Validation lives in `make test-fuse-alpine`, which exercises
`/dev/fuse` plus `mount("fuse")` against the staged Alpine musl
sysroot fixture.

## Packet-Mode Pipes

`O_DIRECT` on a pipe makes every `write` one packet: a `read` returns one
packet and drops what it did not take. A host pipe is a byte stream, so a pipe
in packet mode keeps its data elsewhere. `src/syscall/pipe-ring.c` holds it in
the buffer ring of the kernel's `fs/pipe.c`: 16 buffers of one 4096-byte page
by default, each marked as a packet, as stream data that takes merges, or as
neither when it was spliced in. `pipe_ring_xfer` runs `pipe_read` and
`pipe_write` over that ring, and `io_xfer` sends every transfer on such a pipe
there, so `read`, `write`, `readv`, `writev`, `splice`, `vmsplice` and
`sendfile` all reach it.

The ring is an anonymous temp file, metadata at offset 0 and one page for each
buffer behind it. Every guest fd of the pipe references it through
`fd_entry_t.ring`; `dup`, a reopen through `/proc/self/fd/N`, and `fork` carry
the reference. An `fcntl(F_SETLK)` lock on the file excludes the other
processes that hold the pipe, and the kernel releases it when its holder dies.
`pipe_ring_lock` excludes the threads of one process. Every close of a state
file descriptor runs under that mutex, because closing any descriptor of a
file drops the process's lock on it.

The host pipe stays the guest fd's descriptor and carries tokens: one byte for
each buffer in use, and filler up to its capacity while every buffer is in
use. Host readiness then answers for the ring: readable while a buffer is
queued, writable while one is free, end of file and `EPIPE` once the other
side is gone. `poll`, `epoll`, `select` and the blocking waits therefore need
no knowledge of the ring. A writer adds tokens before it commits the metadata
that accounts for them and a reader removes them after, so a process killed
between the two leaves the host pipe reporting too much, which the next reader
corrects, and never too little.

`pipe2(O_DIRECT)` creates the ring with the pipe. Every other `pipe2` pipe
takes a dormant ring, an object with no state file. `F_SETFL` with `O_DIRECT`
on a write end makes it active: the bytes queued in the host pipe move into
the ring as stream buffers, and the host pipe takes tokens. A counter and a
flag keep a host transfer on a dormant pipe apart from that conversion, and
only a process with more than one thread pays for them.

Another process cannot be told that a pipe it holds has moved into a ring. So
once `fork` or `SCM_RIGHTS` has handed a dormant pipe to one, it stays a host
pipe, and `F_SETFL` records `O_DIRECT` without effect.

### Deviations From Linux

| Linux behavior | elfuse behavior |
|---|---|
| `F_SETFL(O_DIRECT)` starts packet mode on any pipe or FIFO | only on a `pipe2` pipe that no other process holds yet. After a `fork`, after `SCM_RIGHTS`, and on a FIFO the flag is recorded and writes stay a stream: two writes of 2 and 3 bytes read as 5 |
| a pipe fd in packet mode passes over `SCM_RIGHTS` | `sendmsg` fails with `EINVAL`; the receiver would hold the host pipe without the ring |
| stream data queued before `F_SETFL(O_DIRECT)` keeps the buffers its writes made | it is cut into full pages. Writes of 3000 and 3000, then packets of 1500 and 10, read as 7500 and 10 on Linux and as 7510 here, because the second packet finds room to merge |
| `O_DIRECT` belongs to the open file description, so a child that sets or clears it changes the parent's writes | the flag is per process, like every status flag elfuse keeps itself |
| `select` reports a read end not writable; `poll` and `epoll` report a hangup even when asked for no events; edge-triggered `epoll` reports no edge after a read | the host pipe answers these three, as it does for a stream pipe: writable, no report, and one extra edge while packets stay queued |
| `F_SETPIPE_SZ` above 1 MiB succeeds with `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` | `EPERM` |
| `tee` works | `EINVAL`, as for every pipe |

## USB Device Passthrough

`src/syscall/usbdev.c` implements the usbdevfs character device
(`/dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD`) on top of IOKit's `IOUSBDeviceInterface650` and
`IOUSBInterfaceInterface800` plugin interfaces, so Linux USB tools drive
real devices attached to the Mac. macOS arbitrates that access per IOKit
object and dynamically: `USBInterfaceOpen` refuses an interface exactly while
some driver holds that interface open, and grants it while that driver is
idle. An interface bound to an idle Apple class driver therefore does open --
the ESP32-S3's CDC data interface opens whenever nothing holds
`/dev/cu.usbmodem1101` and refuses while something does -- so the layer
attempts the open and maps what IOKit answers rather than deciding from the
presence of a bound driver.

The fd model: opening a node constructs a typed `FD_USBDEV` fd. The open
consults the model, not the hardware: `stat`, `access` and an `O_PATH` open
of the same name are all answered from the model, so requiring a live IOKit
service here would make a plain `O_RDONLY` the one entry point that reported
`ENODEV` for a node the other three describe. The service is resolved on
first use instead, and every operation that needs the wire reports `ENODEV`
when it is not there.

Per-fd state (the IOKit device handle, claimed interfaces, and the
endpoint-to-pipe map) lives in a side table keyed by the guest fd and the fd
generation, so a concurrently closed and reallocated guest fd cannot reach
another open's state. A lookup pins its entry under `usbdev_table_lock` and
then takes the per-entry lock with the table lock released: taking the two
nested meant a thread blocked on one fd's transfer held the table lock on
every other thread's behalf, and one transfer with usbdevfs's documented
"unlimited" `timeout == 0` wedged every usbdevfs fd in the process,
`close()` included. Teardown runs from the fd-cleanup hook, which is handed
a bare fd number after the fd-table slot is already free, so a sibling
thread's open can already hold the same number; among the entries that
answer to it the closing one is the one with the smaller generation, since
`fd_alloc` stamps a globally monotonic counter. `fd_alloc` also publishes the
guest fd before the side table can bind it, so a close landing in that window
would find no entry to tear down; the open rereads the fd's generation once its
entry is findable and retires the entry itself if the close has already been
and gone.

That leaves two windows around the bind, and the entry keeps one identity
across both. Before the bind its `guest_fd` is still -1, so a close finds
nothing; after it, the entry is findable and therefore also freeable, so a
close can reap it, the last unref can free the slot, and a sibling open can
bind its own live fd there before the recheck runs. The generation is the one
`fd_alloc_from` reports from inside the allocating `fd_lock` section, not a
later read of the slot -- read back after the slot was publishable it is
whatever the number carries by then, which in the first window is a reopening
thread's stamp, and two entries then hold the same pair. And the retire path
claims the whole tuple the caller allocated (used and alive, this fd number,
this generation) rather than testing that the slot is not dead, which in the
second window claims the sibling's entry instead. The tuple is sufficient
because slot storage is static, so the read is always defined; all four fields
are written and read under `usbdev_table_lock`, so they are read as one value;
and `fd_next_generation` is globally monotonic, so each entry carries its own
allocation's stamp and no two live entries can present the same pair.

The entry's host fd is a pipe read end reserved for readiness signaling.
`read()` serves the descriptors blob at a per-open file position,
byte-identical to the sysfs `descriptors` attribute; `SEEK_END` is `EINVAL`,
as on Linux usbfs; `fstat` reports a character device, major 189, answered from
the entry's own identity ahead of the `/dev/bus` path stamp, the way a FUSE
descriptor is answered by the layer that owns it. The whole
write family -- `write`, `writev`, `pwrite`, `pwritev` -- is `EBADF` without
`FMODE_WRITE` and `EINVAL` otherwise, the order `vfs_write` checks
`FMODE_WRITE` and then `FMODE_CAN_WRITE`; none of them may fall through to
the readiness pipe behind the fd. The two capability bits are derived once,
the way `OPEN_FMODE` derives them -- `(flags + 1) & O_ACCMODE`, not a
comparison against `O_RDONLY` -- and the four gates that need them (read,
pread, the write family, and the ioctl surface) read that. Access mode 3 is
the case the comparison gets wrong: `open(2)` takes it and `ACC_MODE(3)` asks
this 0666 node for read plus write, which it grants, so Linux hands back a
descriptor carrying neither `FMODE_READ` nor `FMODE_WRITE` and refuses
everything on it. `dup` of the fd is refused with `EBADF`
(the side table is keyed by the guest fd and IOKit plugin handles are
process-local).

The ioctl surface at this layer is whatever `usbdev_ioctl` dispatches, and it
is written down in exactly one place a reader can check:
`tests/usbdev-ioctl-departed.tbl` carries a row per request and
`scripts/gen-usbdev-ioctl-departed.py` fails when the table and the dispatch
disagree. Two of those requests are the synchronous `CONTROL` and `BULK`
transfers, which bounce guest data through host buffers around
`DeviceRequestTO` and `ReadPipeTO` / `WritePipeTO`; they are synchronous in the
guest too, in that the guest thread blocks in the ioctl for the duration of the
request.

errno fidelity is the design rule, because libusb and friends branch on
exact values, and so is the *order* the answers are decided in, which is just
as observable: `check_ctrlrecip` runs before the `wLength` cap and
`findintfep` before the transfer-length checks, so a request naming an
endpoint or interface the device does not have is `ENOENT` however long it
is. The reserved-bit test on an endpoint address lives in the one lookup
`BULK`, `CLEAR_HALT`, `RESETEP` and the control endpoint recipient all go
through, so the four cannot disagree about it. The interface-number bound is
64, `8 * sizeof(unsigned long)` as in `claimintf`; between 64 and 32 an
interface is merely absent, which is a question about the device.

Every argument that comes off the wire is bounded where it enters, not only
where it is used. `bInterfaceNumber` is a device-supplied byte with the whole
0..255 range behind it, and the endpoint-owner lookup reports it back as the
`EINVAL` `checkintf` reports rather than handing a 64-entry array an index of
200. An endpoint address arrives as a 32-bit word and is tested as one, since
narrowing it to a byte first resolves the transfer to an endpoint the caller
did not name; the control path is the exception Linux itself makes, masking
`wIndex` to its low byte before the lookup. An altsetting above 255 matches no
`bAlternateSetting` and is `EINVAL`, after the implicit claim, the order
`proc_setintf` decides them in.

The other half of errno fidelity is that a failure keeps the errno of whatever
failed. `ENODEV` from the model, meaning nothing answers to this address,
becomes the `ENOENT` open(2) owes for a name with nothing behind it; every
other failure on the open path -- an allocation, a scratch-tree `mkdir`, a
pipe the host would not give -- reports itself, so a host out of memory is not
described to the guest as a missing node.

Every ioctl needs `FMODE_WRITE` and is `EPERM` without it (Linux's gate in
`devio.c`). `FIONBIO` and `FIOASYNC` are the exception, because they are not
part of this file's ioctl set at all: `do_vfs_ioctl` answers both for every
file before it reaches `f_op->unlocked_ioctl`, so they never meet that gate.
They are answered where `FIOCLEX` and `FIONCLEX` already are. `FIONBIO` edits
only the guest flag word, the way `F_SETFL` does -- the readiness pipe behind
the fd stays nonblocking whatever the guest asks -- and always reports 0.
`FIOASYNC` reports 0 when the requested `FASYNC` state already holds and
`ENOTTY` when it would change, because `usbdev_file_operations` declares no
`.fasync`.

Transfer memory is one allowance for everything in flight, not a per-call
size cap: Linux charges against a module-global `usbfs_memory_mb` (16 MB) and
refunds when the transfer settles, so a request of exactly the allowance never
fits and concurrent transfers across different fds contend for the same total.
What is charged depends on the path and not on the caller: `do_proc_bulk` and
`proc_do_submiturb` book `len + sizeof(struct urb)`, while `do_proc_control`
books a fixed `PAGE_SIZE + sizeof(struct urb) +
sizeof(struct usb_ctrlrequest)` whatever `wLength` says, because the kernel
bounces every control transfer through one whole page. An atomic counter
carries all three here, charged where Linux charges each and refunded on every
exit including the error arms. `CONTROL` used to be outside it, which is the
one way a guest could keep transferring after the allowance was full.
A claim that IOKit answers `kIOReturnExclusiveAccess` is `EBUSY`,
what Linux reports for an interface held by a kernel driver. `GETDRIVER`
names the bound Apple driver, or `usbfs` for an interface any usbfs fd on
this device holds, or reports `ENODATA`; a user-client child is not a driver,
so another usbfs consumer's `USBInterfaceOpen` is not reported as one. It and
the three claim/connect ops reach the interface through one
`CreateInterfaceIterator`, and `SETCONFIGURATION` opens that same enumeration
to ask whether any interface has a host driver bound. The `usbfs` answer is
the one that has to be made to reach it as well: a claim is this layer's own
bookkeeping, which knows nothing about the device and stays true after it
leaves, so each of those ops opens the enumeration for the device question
before the claim answers rather than instead of it. A device-gone answer
from the call is about the device, so each reports `ENODEV` and stamps the
fd, rather than reporting the interface missing from a device that is missing
entirely or -- for `SETCONFIGURATION`, which is asking about drivers and not
about one interface -- reading an enumeration that never ran as "no driver is
bound" and changing the configuration of a device that had departed. Linux
gets the same answer one level up, from the `connected()` gate
`usbdev_do_ioctl` runs before any of them.
Transfer errors map per `devio.c`: a stall is `EPIPE`, a timeout
`ETIMEDOUT`, a vanished device `ENODEV`. `kIOReturnAborted` maps to `EINTR`
with `syscall_restart_forbid()`, because the transfer was already on the wire
and a dispatcher restart would send it twice.

Known gaps at this stage, each printed as an XFAIL by
`tests/test-usbdev-ioctl.c` rather than only written down here:

- `GET_CAPABILITIES` reports `ZERO_PACKET | REAP_AFTER_DISCONNECT`, the two
  the URB engine below honors. `BULK_CONTINUATION` stays clear because the
  flag is accepted without its error-cascade unlink, and the two remaining
  bits describe URB splitting IOKit does not expose.
- Two ioctls on one fd serialize, because the entry lock is held across the
  blocking transfer. Linux drops the device lock around the URB wait.
- `GETDRIVER` reports the IOKit class name (`AppleUSBACMControl`) where Linux
  reports the driver's name (`cdc_acm`), and `DISCONNECT_CLAIM`'s name filters
  compare against it.
- `RESET` kills the device's URBs and clears the claimed pipes' stalls
  instead of re-enumerating the port, which would destroy the handles. The
  URB kill is the half `usb_reset_device` does have; the re-enumeration is
  the half it does not get. A per-pipe stall clear that fails is logged, not
  returned: the clears are the substitute, and refusing a `RESET` Linux
  performs would be the worse answer.
- `CLEAR_HALT` and `RESETEP` cancel whatever is outstanding on the endpoint,
  so a queued async URB there reaps `ECONNRESET`. Linux's
  `check_reset_of_active_ep` only warns and leaves the queue alone, and
  IOKit exposes no stall clear that does not abort the pipe. libusb calls
  `libusb_clear_halt` between transfers, so this is reachable in ordinary
  use.
- The per-endpoint abort shutter (`ep_aborting`) is an invariant of the paths
  that abort deliberately, not of the slot: `DISCARDURB` and every wholesale
  kill raise it, `CLEAR_HALT` and `RESETEP` do not, because
  `ClearPipeStallBothEnds` aborts the pipe as a side effect and IOKit exposes
  no variant that does not. A queued follower can therefore be started behind
  a stall clear's abort that is still in flight. Linux has no such shutter to
  keep; the guest-visible half of the gap is the `ECONNRESET` row above.
- A printer's `GET_DEVICE_ID` names its interface in the **high** byte of
  `wIndex` and an alt setting in the low one, and `check_ctrlrecip` lets that
  one request through untouched: it returns before the `index &= 0xff` when
  the request type is `0xa1`, the request is `0`, and
  `usb_find_alt_setting(actconfig, index >> 8, index & 0xff)` has class
  `USB_CLASS_PRINTER`. Both control paths here read `wIndex & 0xff` as the
  interface number for every non-vendor interface recipient, so on a printer
  such a request implicitly claims the alt setting's number instead of the
  interface's. Demonstrating it needs a printer attached, so it is recorded
  rather than modeled.
- A URB's `signr`, like `DISCSIGNAL`'s, is accepted, reported as success and
  never delivered: elfuse has no async guest-signal injection from the event
  thread.
- `DISCARDURB` waits for IOKit's abort to settle, so a `REAPURBNDELAY`
  issued straight afterwards finds the URB the way it does on Linux, but the
  wait is bounded at 2 s rather than unbounded. The kernel call this matches
  is the one `proc_unlinkurb` actually makes, `usb_kill_urb`, which is
  synchronous ("upon return all completion handlers will have finished") --
  not `usb_unlink_urb`, the asynchronous unlink, which `proc_unlinkurb` does
  not call. Waiting is therefore the faithful half and the 2 s ceiling is the
  divergence: Linux never gives up, so `libusb_cancel_transfer` on a wedged
  endpoint blocks there for as long as the transfer lives, where here it
  returns 0 after 2 s with the record still flagged and still reapable when
  its completion arrives. An abort that is refused outright is a different
  answer and gets one: `kIOReturnNoDevice` from `AbortPipe` or
  `USBDeviceAbortPipeZero` means the user client has no device behind it, so
  it aborted nothing and no completion is coming. Both used to be cast to
  `void`, which spent the whole 2 s waiting for a callback that could not
  arrive, returned 0 to the guest with the fd unstamped, and left the URB in
  the pending list where the next `REAPURB` waited on it for ever. It now
  stamps the fd, the way every other op's device-gone answer does, and hands
  the record back as an orphan -- reapable at once, with its buffer and
  handles pinned until a callback that may never come.
- `SETINTERFACE` and `SETCONFIGURATION` report `EBUSY` when that same 2 s
  drain expires with transfers still outstanding. Linux cannot reach this:
  `usb_kill_urb` does not give up, so the kill always finishes and the change
  always proceeds. Both retire the handles the survivors still reference --
  the interface's pipeRefs, and the whole pipe table -- so the two decide it
  once, in `usbdev_drain_for_change`, rather than each on its own. A drain
  that expires settles the slot's own counters, unlinks the survivors, hands
  each of them back on the completed list with the `ENOENT` `usb_kill_urb`
  leaves, pins the handle it still references -- the interface's, or the
  device's for an ep0 record, which names no interface -- and then restarts
  every endpoint FIFO exactly as the successful path does:
  `draining` shut all of them, including the ones the kill did not match, and
  an endpoint whose leader completed inside the window would otherwise be left
  with a queued URB, none in flight and nothing to restart it. The
  process-wide byte budget is not settled there -- it accounts live memory,
  and a survivor's buffer is still owned by an in-flight IOKit transfer, so
  its charge is given back where the buffer is freed, in the late callback.
  `USBDEVFS_RESET` deliberately proceeds instead: a wedged transfer is the
  state a guest issues `RESET` to escape, and a stall clear leaves the
  pipeRefs where they are.
- A short bulk OUT is `EIO`: `WritePipeTO` reports no length, and reporting
  the requested count would spell a partial write as a complete one.
- The side table holds 32 open fds per process and reports `ENOMEM` past
  that; Linux allocates a `usb_dev_state` per open and has no such limit.
- `USBDEVFS_IOCTL DISCONNECT` of an interface another usbfs fd holds is
  `EBUSY`; Linux releases that claim and answers 0.

### The URB Engine

`SUBMITURB` validates the URB type and flags the way `devio.c` does, copies
the guest buffer into a host bounce buffer on the vCPU thread, and queues
the URB per endpoint. At most one URB per endpoint is in flight at IOKit at
a time; later submissions queue inside elfuse and are started from the
completion callback. The queue exists because cancellation granularity
differs: `DISCARDURB` must kill exactly one URB, but IOKit's `AbortPipe`
(`USBDeviceAbortPipeZero` for ep0) aborts every outstanding transfer on the
pipe.

"Per endpoint" is a list and not a filter. Each pending record sits in the
fd-wide pending list and in its endpoint's own intrusive FIFO at once, and that
FIFO's head is the record in flight there when the endpoint has one and the
next to start otherwise -- so append, unlink and restart are each O(1). Reading
the same three answers out of the fd-wide list was not: every completion walked
it twice, once to unlink and once to find its endpoint's next record, and every
submit walked it a third time to decide whether the endpoint was busy, all
under `async_lock` on the one event thread that carries every fd's completions.
Measured on the loopback fixture as the median of 31 submit-to-reap round trips
on one endpoint against a second endpoint's pending depth, before: 0.017 ms at
depth 0, 0.334 at 20k, 1.848 at 80k and 2.688 at 100k. After: 0.016, 0.025,
0.020 and 0.021 ms. Linux is O(1) both ways (`list_move_tail`,
`devio.c:634`). The fd-wide list stays, because five callers genuinely need
every record and not one endpoint's: the wholesale abort, the drain's
still-busy scan, the drain timeout's orphaning, `DISCARDURB`'s lookup by user
pointer, and the reap's "is anything still out" test. The three extra link
words take the record from 136 to 160 bytes, which the process-wide byte budget
pays for: 104857 zero-length URBs now fit in the 16 MB allowance where 123361
did.

One URB on the wire is not by itself enough. `DISCARDURB` drops `async_lock`
to issue the abort, and in that window the target can complete normally and
the completion callback can start the queued follower, which the abort then
cancels instead -- measured against the attached board at a handful per
hundred thousand at natural rates, and reproducibly there with the window
widened, as the discarded URB reaping success and its innocent successor
reaping `ECONNRESET`. The rate is the board's: the loopback fixture
retargets an aborted transfer's timer under its own lock and cannot start a
follower into an abort that is still running, so it shows this at no rate at
all. The endpoint's FIFO therefore stays shut for the duration of the abort,
and `DISCARDURB` waits for the record to leave the pending list before it
returns. With both, a discarded URB reaps `ENOENT` and any other abort reaps
`ECONNRESET`, mirroring `usb_kill_urb` against an async unlink.

Two caps that used to be elfuse's own are gone. The 16 MB budget is one
process-wide byte count, the way `usbfs_memory_usage` is one kernel-wide
static, and there is no URB-count cap: a 257th eight-byte URB on one fd
used to be `ENOMEM` against a 16 MB budget, which is exactly the ring depth
libusb's async API builds for bulk streaming. A URB's record is charged
alongside its buffer, so zero-length URBs are bounded too.

Completions land on one lazily-started host thread driving a CFRunLoop --
the first CFRunLoop in the codebase -- fed by
`CreateDeviceAsyncEventSource` / `CreateInterfaceAsyncEventSource`, which
is libusb's own darwin model. The teardown discipline is inherited from
netlink's blocking-recv rule (netlink.c): no host thread ever touches
guest memory. The
callback moves only usbdev-owned host memory (fd slots, URB records, the
completion pipe); copy-in at submit and copy-out at reap both run on the
vCPU thread. That is what makes the thread safe across `execve` and guest
teardown, so it is started once and never joined.

`REAPURB` blocks in `io_wait_fd_or_interrupted` on the completion pipe and
copies the result out on the vCPU thread. What that pipe carries is a level,
not a running count: it holds exactly one byte while the fd has a completion
to hand back or has been disconnected, and none otherwise, restored under
`async_lock` by every path that can move either term. A byte per completion
would not survive the absence of a URB-count cap -- a zero-length URB costs
only its record against the 16 MB budget, so far more records fit than the
pipe has room for bytes, and a byte that does not fit would leave its record
reapable with nothing readable behind it. The `actual_length` it reports is
clamped to the buffer the guest submitted, the way every Linux HCD bounds
`urb->actual_length` by `transfer_buffer_length`; IOKit's transferred count is
a device-supplied number and is not passed through. A signal interrupts it
with `EINTR` and `syscall_restart_forbid()`, because Linux's reap path does
not restart. `REAPURBNDELAY` reports `EAGAIN` when nothing has completed.
`ZERO_PACKET` on a maxpacket-multiple OUT emits the trailing zero-length write
from the completion callback, and `SHORT_NOT_OK` turns a short IN into
`EREMOTEIO` at completion.

### Poll Semantics

usbfs readiness is inverted relative to a pipe: `POLLOUT` means "completed
URBs are reapable", and `POLLIN` is never signaled. The completion pipe's read
end raises host `POLLIN`, so `ppoll` and `pselect6` remap it to the
guest-visible `POLLOUT | POLLWRNORM`, and epoll registers `EVFILT_READ` on the
pipe but reports `EPOLLOUT`, through a per-registration flag. The host
interest is always armed, whatever events the guest asked for: a disconnected
device raises the unmaskable `POLLERR | POLLHUP`, and the pipe is the only
wake source that reaches a read-only waiter. Disconnect raises the readiness
level and nothing lowers it again, which is what a sticky `POLLERR | POLLHUP`
needs. Because the level is one token rather than a count, an `EPOLLET`
registration is edged once per rise rather than once per completion. A
consumer that reaps to `EAGAIN` sees no difference, which is the contract
`EPOLLET` states and the one `tests/test-epoll-edge.c` pins; one that reaps a
single URB per wake and re-arms would wait here where Linux, whose usbfs wakes
the wait queue once per completion, fires again. Stated rather than tested:
reaching it needs a guest that breaks the `EPOLLET` contract. A wake that maps
to nothing guest-visible re-blocks: the woken entry's host interest is
withdrawn for the rest of the call (unreaped completions keep the pipe
readable, so leaving it armed would busy-spin), the wait resumes in bounded
slices that re-check the lock-free disconnect map, and epoll additionally
re-adds a fired `EV_ONESHOT` knote disabled so a wake the guest never saw
cannot consume an `EPOLLONESHOT` arm. epoll_wait therefore never returns 0
before its timeout, matching Linux `ep_poll`. Undoing those mutes on the way
out reads the registration and applies the knote change in one step under the
instance lock: with the lock dropped in between, a concurrent `EPOLL_CTL_MOD`
could re-arm the registration after the delete had been decided on, and the
`EV_DELETE` then retired the knote that `MOD` had just installed, leaving an
active registration with nothing behind it.

`EPOLLPRI` is not defined in this layer and nothing below produces the
conditions Linux raises it for -- socket out-of-band data, a `sysfs` attribute
poke -- so it is left unmodeled rather than half-wired onto `EVFILT_EXCEPT`,
which would be a guess about which of the two the guest meant. A registration
naming `EPOLLPRI` alone arms no filter and so hears nothing at all, the
otherwise unmaskable `EPOLLERR | EPOLLHUP` included, since both reach the guest
only through a knote that fired.

Both readiness masks are read as pairs, on every registration and not only on a
usbfs one. `eventpoll` has no mask of its own: `ep_item_poll` masks the file's
answer by `epi->event.events`, so a registration naming only `EPOLLRDNORM` or
only `EPOLLWRNORM` is a legal registration Linux both wakes and reports back in
the spelling it was asked in. Every readiness source below raises the bit
alongside its `EPOLLIN` or `EPOLLOUT` twin -- a pipe, a socket and a tty on the
read side, and on the write side a pipe with room, a writable TCP socket, and a
unix or datagram socket, which add `EPOLLWRBAND` as well -- so this layer arms
`EVFILT_READ` for either read bit and `EVFILT_WRITE` for either write bit, at
`ADD`, at `MOD` and at `DEL`, and reports back the intersection rather than the
canonical spelling. `tests/test-epoll.c` pins both halves. Two asymmetries are
deliberate. Linux `EPOLLWRBAND` (0x200) is in neither pair, and neither is its
`poll` twin: `POLL_WRITE_EVENTS` is `POLLOUT | POLLWRBAND`, but that token is
the *macOS* `POLLWRBAND`, which is 0x100 -- the value Linux spells
`POLLWRNORM` -- so the two halves arm on the same two Linux bits, 0x104, and
Linux `POLLWRBAND` is absent from both. And a registration naming no read bit
at all still has its read filter armed for `EPOLLRDHUP`, so that one arm
reports the `EPOLLIN` it always did rather than an entry with no events in it.
A usbfs fd is unaffected by either: its read filter is armed whatever the mask
says, and `usbdev_poll` raises neither read bit ever.

### Disconnect And Fork

An `IOServiceAddInterestNotification` on the runloop (or
`kIOReturnNoDevice` / `kIOReturnNotAttached` from any op -- every op
translates its IOKit status through `usbdev_ioret_op`, the synchronous
transfers and the setup calls included, so an op that sees either of those
two codes originates the disconnect rather than only reporting it) marks
**every** usbfs fd open on that device disconnected, not only the one that
noticed: poll reports `POLLERR | POLLHUP`, `REAPURB` hands back every URB and
then reports `ENODEV`, and once an fd carries that mark every other usbdevfs
ioctl on it reports `ENODEV` too -- the usbfs disconnect contract. Only
usbdevfs: the requests `do_vfs_ioctl` answers before `f_op->unlocked_ioctl`
never reach this layer's gate on Linux and do not here either, so a marked fd
still answers `FIONBIO` 0 and `FIOQSIZE` `ENOTTY`. Not meeting the gate is not
the same as matching Linux, though: this layer models none of those requests and
answers `ENOTTY` to all ten, where Linux agrees on two and answers from the
superblock, from `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or from the argument for the other eight.
`check_vfs_ioctls` in `tests/test-usbdev-ioctl.c` carries both values for each,
drives them on a read-only and on a writable fd, and prints the eight as
`XFAIL`. The scope is the
mark, not the device: an fd that has not been told yet answers per request,
and which requests answer what is `tests/usbdev-ioctl-departed.tbl` rather
than a sentence here. `tests/test-usbdev-ioctl-departed.c` drives both halves,
the marked fd's whole usbdevfs surface and the requests beside it that are not
usbdevfs included. The cross-fd half of
it is what `usbdev_remove` does by walking `udev->filelist`, and it has to be
a walk here for the same reason: a device is gone for every consumer of it at
once, and a second fd on the node has nothing of its own that would find out.
`usbdev_ioret_device_gone`, the predicate that decides origination, is
deliberately narrower than the `ENODEV` row of `ioret_neg_errno`, which also
carries `kIOReturnNotOpen`. That code is what IOKit answers for a handle
nobody has opened yet, so a control request that arrives before the lazy
`USBDeviceOpen` draws it from a device that is plainly still attached: it
answers `ENODEV`, the way Linux answers for a device it cannot reach, and it
does not stamp. Widening the predicate to cover it would mark a live fd gone
on its first control request.

"Every URB" is what
`CAP_REAP_AFTER_DISCONNECT` promises, stated as one invariant: after a
disconnect every URB still in flight comes back **before** any reap answers
`ENODEV`, whichever reap flavor asked first. `usbdev_remove` delivers it for
free by running `destroy_all_async` -- a synchronous `usb_kill_urb` each --
before it wakes the reapers, so a Linux reap cannot observe the disconnect
until the pending list is already empty. IOKit completes nothing of its own
when a device terminates, so the first reap that finds the completion list
empty on a disconnected fd issues that kill itself, and its aborts land
asynchronously. The window Linux does not have -- disconnected, aborts issued,
URBs not back yet -- is real here, so `ENODEV` is decided by the pending list
being empty and never by a flag saying some earlier pass did the work. A
blocking `REAPURB` waits for the kill to settle, latch or no latch.
`REAPURBNDELAY` issues the same aborts, does not wait for them, and answers
`EAGAIN` -- `proc_reapurbnonblock`'s other arm -- until they land: a
non-blocking ioctl that sat out the two-second drain deadline holding the fd's
`async_lock` against every `SUBMITURB` and `DISCARDURB` was the worse half of
the contract, but so was answering `ENODEV` with the URBs still in flight,
which is what a one-shot flag doing both jobs did to every reap behind it.

Both flavors reach the end of that conversation, and reach it inside one drain
deadline of the aborts. A wire can answer no abort at all, and then what
empties the pending list is the deadline: the blocking reap spends it in the
kill's wait and orphans the survivors on the way out, and the non-blocking one
measures the same deadline instead of waiting it out and orphans them itself.
Without that second half only the blocking flavor had a ceiling, so a
`libusb_handle_events_timeout(0)` loop -- non-blocking reaps and nothing else,
the common shape -- got `EAGAIN` for ever against a wedged endpoint while
`poll` held `POLLERR|POLLHUP`, where Linux answers
`connected(ps) ? -EAGAIN : -ENODEV` and the application tears down. What the
deadline gives up on is the wire answering, not the URB: the record is handed
back on the same pass that gives up on it, carrying the `ENOENT`
`destroy_all_async`'s `usb_kill_urb` leaves, and stays alive behind that
hand-back until IOKit's callback arrives -- whichever of the reap and the
callback comes second frees it. That is the last place
`CAP_REAP_AFTER_DISCONNECT` did not hold: the deadline used to unlink the
record, mark it and drop it, so the pass that gave up answered `ENODEV` with
the URB pointer never returned.

The
refcon that carries the disconnect notification packs the slot index in a
field sized from the slot table, not in a hand-written four bits: with 32
slots and four bits, slot 16+k decoded as slot k, so half the table never
saw a disconnect and the other half could be marked gone while attached. Across `fork` the fd is dropped and the child sees
`EBADF`, like `FD_NETLINK` and `FD_INOTIFY` today: IOKit plugin handles
are Mach-port-backed and cannot cross the `posix_spawn` that implements
fork.

### Testing The Engine Without Hardware

IOKit publishes no loopback device, so the async engine had no in-tree lane at
all: `ELFUSE_USB_FIXTURE`'s devices have no IOKit service behind them and stop
at `SUBMITURB`'s argument gate. `ELFUSE_USB_FIXTURE=loopback` adds one that
does, in the `USB_LOOPBACK_FIXTURE=1` build that links the model rather than
the stub (below), by substituting at the narrowest place that leaves every
layer above it real: the two COM vtables. Every wire call in `usbdev.c` goes
through `IOUSBDeviceInterface650 **` or `IOUSBInterfaceInterface800 **` as
`(*h)->Method(h, ...)`, so `src/syscall/usbdev-fixture.c` hands back an object
whose first member is a vtable of the same shape and nothing above it changes.
The URB records, the per-endpoint FIFO, the completion callback, `urb_status`,
the ZLP predicate, the readiness and disconnect maps, `REAPURB`, the drain and
all of `poll.c` are the same code that runs against a board. Completions arrive
from a one-shot `CFRunLoopTimer` on the event thread, which is where
`IODispatchCalloutFromCFMessage` would have delivered them.

What the fixture does is a script rather than a flag:
`ELFUSE_USB_LOOPBACK=ep02:delay(80),ok;ep81:short(8)` and the rest of the
vocabulary in `src/syscall/usbdev-fixture.c` name the `IOReturn` each outcome
stands for, and a guest can rewrite the script, read back a log of what crossed
the seam and terminate the device through vendor control requests. The log is
what makes the `ZERO_PACKET` trailing packet observable rather than inferred.

The seam is five `if (u->fake)` branches, one has-device probe and one bind
call in `usbdev.c`, all behind a mode resolved once per process, and the flag
is set only for the one location the fixture models -- so the other fixture modes, and every real
device, take the paths they took before. `make test-usbdev-ioctl-loopback` is
the standing check on that: the fd-contract lane must answer the same thing
with the loopback device present as without it.

A device that can be made to leave on demand is what the third loopback lane
needs. `make test-usbdev-ioctl-departed` terminates the fixture's device once
and then drives every usbdevfs ioctl the layer implements against it, asserting
four things per request: the `ioctl(2)` return, the `errno` behind it, the poll
revents left on the fd that asked, and the revents on another fd open on the
same node, which is what says the disconnect was recorded against the device
rather than against one caller. The surface is not a list anyone maintains:
`scripts/gen-usbdev-ioctl-departed.py` reads it out of `usbdev_ioctl`'s own
dispatch and refuses to emit the lane's vectors unless every request it
dispatches has a row in `tests/usbdev-ioctl-departed.tbl` saying what Linux
answers and why -- so an ioctl added to the layer fails `make check` until its
departed-device answer is recorded. `make check-usbdev-departed` is that gate on
its own.

The default arm is in the join too, and had to be added to it: a join built
from case labels alone covers every arm except the one catching what no label
matches, which is how that arm's `ENOTTY` on a departed device survived the
table built to find exactly that kind of answer. A row may name a `USBDEVFS_`
request `usbdev.c` defines and dispatches nowhere, the generator refuses to
emit while the arm exists with no row driving it, and three rows do.

A row whose elfuse answer differs from Linux's carries both values and is an
XFAIL: the lane fails if the difference widens and fails if it quietly closes,
so a deliberate gap stays a recorded measurement instead of becoming a sentence
in a comment. The lane runs three times because one process can hold only one
departed device: the first correct `ENODEV` stamps every fd open on the node,
so the rows that need a claim taken before the device left cannot share a
process with the rows that take it away.

None of that is in the shipped binary. `src/syscall/usbdev-fixture.c` is a
translation unit under `src/` that only an assertion has a use for, so the
default build links `src/syscall/usbdev-fixture-stub.c` in its place: the same
seven entry points, answering `false` and `-ENODEV`, 44 bytes of text against
the model's 11 KB. `USB_LOOPBACK_FIXTURE=1` swaps the two, and it names the
binary as well: `mk/config.mk` points `ELFUSE_BIN` at `$(ELFUSE_LOOPBACK_BIN)`
for that flavor, so the fixture build writes `build/elfuse-loopback` and a
plain `make` leaves `build/elfuse` without the model. The name is what carries
that, because nothing else does. The switch changes `SRCS` and not `CFLAGS`,
and the stale-object guard in `mk/common.mk` is keyed on `CFLAGS` alone, so
while both flavors wrote one path a fixture build left the model in
`build/elfuse` and the next `make elfuse` answered "Nothing to be done" --
measured on the tree as it stood before this split, at 834288 bytes with `nm`
finding `_usbdev_fixture_lock`, against 815984 clean, until a `make clean`.
That sequence cannot be run again to re-measure, which is what the split is
for, so those two figures stay dated to the pre-split tree and are the only
place this series records them. What reproduces on the tree as it stands is the
pair the paths now keep apart: a clean `build/elfuse` is 815984 bytes with the
symbol 0 times, and `build/elfuse-loopback` is 834304 bytes with it once. Both
are link outputs, so they hold only for the compiler that produced them:
Homebrew `clang` 22.1.8, reached through `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin` on
`PATH`, which is the same toolchain the format gate already requires. Built
with Apple `clang` 17.0.0 from `/usr/bin` instead -- which is what `CC :=
clang` in `mk/toolchain.mk` finds when that directory is not on `PATH` -- the
same two commits give 817776 and 836160, deterministic: +1792 on the default
flavor and +1856 on the loopback one, a gap per flavor rather than one
constant. So a byte count that does not match here is a different compiler
before it is a different tree, and the two symbol counts, 0 and 1, are what
hold under either.
`.ci/check-usb-fixture-bin.sh` fails if the two paths are ever equal again.
Which object defines the seam is the whole difference between the two builds:
not one branch in `usbdev.c` is conditionally compiled, so the fixture cannot
drift into code the default build never compiles, and the default build still
pays the branch that keeps the fixture off every path it must not touch.

### Deviations From Linux

| usbfs behavior | elfuse behavior |
|---|---|
| `RESET` re-enumerates the device | asks the device first, then kills the URBs and clears the claimed pipes' stall state and returns 0; `USBDeviceReEnumerate` would tear down every open plugin handle |
| every ioctl answers `ENODEV` once the device is gone, from `usbdev_do_ioctl`'s `connected()` gate | some answer from the open-time model or from this layer's own bookkeeping instead, on an fd that has not yet been told the device left. Which ones, and what each answers, is one row per request in `tests/usbdev-ioctl-departed.tbl`; the list is not repeated here, because it was written down wrong twice |
| isochronous URBs | `EINVAL` |
| `DISCSIGNAL` delivers a signal on disconnect | signal and context stored, never delivered |
| sync `BULK` on an interrupt endpoint works (converted to an interrupt URB) | `EINVAL`; the conversion exists only on the async URB path |
| `BULK_CONTINUATION` unlinks the rest of the cascade on error | flag accepted, no cascade unlink |
| `dup` of a usbfs fd works | `EBADF` |

## procfs And Device Emulation

`src/runtime/procemu.c` intercepts a focused set of guest-visible paths
under `/proc`, `/dev`, and a few Linux-expected compatibility files:

- Many procfs files are synthesized from host-side runtime state.
- `/proc/self/*` is backed by internal region, FD-table, and process data.
- Synthetic proc directories support common traversal patterns used by
  BusyBox `ps`, `uptime`, and `top`.
- Guest cwd handling preserves a virtual `/proc` working directory even
  though the host operates on synthetic backing directories.

### Reported Kernel Identity

Two surfaces tell the guest which kernel it is running on: `uname(2)`, served
from a static `linux_utsname_t` in `src/syscall/sys.c`, and `/proc/version`,
emitted as a literal by `src/runtime/procemu.c`. Both spell the release
through `GUEST_KERNEL_RELEASE` and `GUEST_KERNEL_VERSION` in
`src/syscall/sys.h`, so the two cannot disagree; `tests/test-proc.c` asserts
that the release `uname` reports appears in the `/proc/version` banner.

The reported release is `6.18.0`, the 6.18 LTS baseline; it tracks no test
image. `elfuse` emits no `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease`, so glibc's
`dl_discover_osversion` falls back to `uname(2)` and reads this value at
every dynamic startup. It refuses a kernel only when the release is below its
build-time floor, so a high baseline is the safe side.

The release feeds version-gated feature detection. `src/syscall/dispatch.tbl`
is the implemented set with two exceptions: `pidfd_getfd` and `userfaultfd`
are registered there, but their handlers in `src/syscall/syscall.c` return
`-ENOSYS`, and `tests/test-pidfd.c` and `tests/test-userfaultfd.c` pin them
at that stub. Anything absent from the table gets `-ENOSYS` from the dispatch
default, whatever number `uname` prints. Calls a 6.18 kernel provides that
are absent: `io_uring_*`, `mseal`, `cachestat`, `process_madvise`,
`listmount`/`statmount`, `landlock_*`, and `file_getattr`/`file_setattr`.
Guests probe for a syscall and handle `ENOSYS`.

The `LINUX_2.6.39` tag in the synthetic vDSO (`src/core/vdso.c`) is the
frozen ELF symbol-version name the real arm64 vDSO exports; a genuine 6.18
kernel emits it too.

Three things read the release automatically. `tests/test-proc.c` runs on both
the elfuse and the qemu aarch64 lane and checks only that the banner and
`uname` agree, so on the qemu lane it pins the real Alpine kernel to itself.
`tests/test-comprehensive.c` asserts the release is at least 6.18 behind a
`uts.nodename == "elfuse"` gate, which holds on the elfuse lanes and not on
the qemu lane, whose initramfs hostname is `elfuse-qemu`. The third reader is
silent: `build/bench-hot-guard-glibc` is the one aarch64 glibc binary in
`make check`, built only when the cross-toolchain sysroot is present, and a
release below glibc's floor would abort its startup rather than fail an
assertion. The Alpine tree `tests/fetch-fixtures.sh` builds is musl
throughout and does no version gating.

`/proc/self/smaps` and `/proc/<pid>/smaps` are generated from the same tracked
VMA list as `/proc/self/maps`. The complete field set currently emitted for
each VMA is the maps header followed by these 24 fields, in this order:

```text
Size, KernelPageSize, MMUPageSize, Rss, Pss, Pss_Dirty,
Shared_Clean, Shared_Dirty, Private_Clean, Private_Dirty, Referenced,
Anonymous, KSM, LazyFree, AnonHugePages, ShmemPmdMapped, FilePmdMapped,
Shared_Hugetlb, Private_Hugetlb, Swap, SwapPss, Locked, THPeligible,
VmFlags
```

`Size` is the VMA length in KiB. `KernelPageSize` and `MMUPageSize` are
reported as 4 KiB. In a fork child, writable private anonymous VMAs that
existed in the parent's CoW snapshot report their full VMA size for
`Shared_Dirty`, `Rss`, `Pss`, and `Pss_Dirty`, keeping those coarse counters
internally consistent. Newly-created VMAs are excluded from that signal. Every
other numeric counter, including `THPeligible`, is emitted as a stable zero.
`ProtectionKey` (a Linux pkeys field added in Linux 4.9) is intentionally
omitted because the macOS host has no equivalent; consumers comparing against a
real Linux kernel should treat it as optional. `VmFlags` is evidence-based and
contains only the permission/sharing flags represented by the tracked VMA
(`rd`, `wr`, `ex`, `sh`, and `nr` when applicable); no untracked kernel flags
are invented. A VMA with no such evidence (for example `PROT_NONE`) still
prints the field's separating space as `VmFlags: `.
These are coarse VMA-level values, not host page-residency, dirty-bit, or
proportional-sharing accounting, so they are suitable for fork-safety checks
but not precise memory profiling. The fork-child marker is tracked per VMA, so
writable private anonymous mappings created after fork are excluded from the
compatibility signal. `smaps_rollup` is not implemented.

Synthetic proc directories have explicit snapshot boundaries. The backing
trees reached by opening `/proc` or `/proc/self` are materialized once, on the
first access, and their initial `stat`, `status`, `cmdline`, `maps`, and `smaps`
files remain fixed for the process lifetime. An absolute open of one of those
proc paths is intercepted directly and generates fresh content; opening the
same name through an already-open synthetic directory reads that directory's
snapshot. `/proc/self/fd` and `/proc/self/fdinfo` are rebuilt into an
independent scratch directory on every open, so each directory fd sees the
guest-fd table as it existed at that open and concurrent enumerations cannot
mutate one another. `/proc/self/task` is repopulated from the current thread
set whenever the directory is opened. These boundaries are intentional: a
directory stream is stable while it is being read, while dynamic task and fd
listings refresh only when a new directory is opened. The synthetic
`/sys/devices/system/cpu` tree follows the one-shot rule: its CPU count,
cpumask files, and `cpuN` directories are captured on first access and then
remain fixed.

### Synthetic USB Device Tree

`src/runtime/usb-sysfs.c` materializes two more scratch-directory trees,
built from an IOKit enumeration of the USB registry that opens no device:
`/sys/bus/usb/devices` and `/dev/bus/usb`. Device directories are named
`<bus>-<ports>` (for example `2-1.4`), interface directories
`<bus>-<ports>:<config>.<interface>`, following the Linux sysfs layout that
libusb and nusb walk. `busnum` comes from the IOKit locationID's top byte
plus one (macOS numbers controllers from 0, Linux busses from 1), `devnum`
from the device's USB address, and the port path from the locationID
nibbles. Each device directory carries the attribute
files those enumerators read (`busnum`, `devnum`, `idVendor`, `idProduct`,
`speed`, the `manufacturer` / `product` / `serial` strings when the device
supplies them, the `dev` major:minor, and the rest of the descriptor
fields), a `uevent` file, a `subsystem` symlink, and the binary
`descriptors` blob.

Two invariants matter to consumers. The `descriptors` attribute and the
matching `/dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD` node read byte-identically, because both
serve one stored blob per device -- the rule Linux keeps between sysfs and
the usbfs `read()` view. And `statfs` / `fstatfs` on `/sys` paths report
`SYSFS_MAGIC`, without which libudev refuses to trust the tree and libusb
falls back to a usbfs directory scan.

The `/dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD` nodes are 0444 placeholder files on disk (the
`/dev/pts` placeholder pattern); the stat intercept reports them as
character devices, major 189, minor `(bus - 1) * 128 + (dev - 1)`, and the
open intercept diverts an open away from the placeholder into the usbdevfs
fd constructor (see [USB Device Passthrough](#usb-device-passthrough)).

One layout deviation is deliberate: the `/sys/bus/usb/devices` entries are
real directories, not symlinks into `/sys/devices/...`, so `realpath()` of
an entry canonicalizes to itself. libusb opens attributes relative to the
entry and nusb canonicalizes the entry path; both tolerate this.

The tree follows the `/sys/devices/system/cpu` one-shot rule: it is built
lazily under `usb_lock` on first access and then stays fixed for the
process. Hotplug support, once the uevent layer can observe attach and
detach, would discard the tree so that the next access re-enumerates; until
then a replugged device is not picked up within a run.

A second, smaller deviation is in `/dev/bus/usb`: the device nodes are
placeholder files, so `getdents64` reports them with `d_type` `DT_REG`
where Linux reports `DT_CHR`. `stat()` is correct -- the intercept fills
`S_IFCHR` with major 189 and the right minor, which is what libusb, nusb
and `lsusb` consult -- so only a scanner that filters on `d_type` alone,
without ever calling `stat`, would skip the nodes. No such consumer is
known; creating real character devices needs privileges elfuse does not
ask for, so the placeholder stays and the deviation is recorded here
rather than papered over.

One boundary is worth stating plainly: there are no `usbN` root-hub
entries. macOS publishes no root hub as a USB device -- the registry match
returns downstream devices only -- so the tree carries no bus entry and no
parent link from a device up to it. Enumeration is unaffected (libusb
leaves the parent NULL, nusb skips port-less names), but topology is: a
`lsusb -t` listing shows the devices without the bus rows above them.

The `configuration` attribute is the other one. It holds the string named
by the active configuration's `iConfiguration`, and a string descriptor is
fetched over an ep0 control transfer on an open device -- which this layer
does not do. IOKit does not offer a way around it: an `IOUSBHostDevice`
registry entry publishes `iManufacturer`, `iProduct` and `iSerialNumber`
alongside the three strings the family caches for them, but no
`iConfiguration` and no configuration string. So the file is emitted
empty, and that is not a claim the configuration has no string: Linux's
`usb_cache_string` returns NULL "if the index is 0 **or the string could
not be read**", and `configuration_show` emits nothing in both cases, so
an empty `configuration` on Linux means "no cached string" and every
device here takes the second of those two routes to it. The file stays
present rather than being omitted, because `dev_attr_grp` carries no
`.is_visible` hook and so every Linux USB device has all four of
`bNumInterfaces`, `bmAttributes`, `bMaxPower` and `configuration`; a value
the kernel cannot supply is a zero-length read, never an `ENOENT`. The
same rule is why those first three are emitted even for a device whose
descriptor blob carries no usable configuration at all. The fidelity gap
that remains is narrow and one-directional: a device whose
`iConfiguration` is non-zero and whose string descriptor is readable shows
that string on Linux and shows nothing here.

Related implementation: `src/runtime/procemu.c`, `src/syscall/path.c`,
`src/syscall/fs.c`, `src/syscall/proc-state.c`, `src/runtime/usb-sysfs.c`.

### Ownership Of `/sys` And `/dev/bus` Names

The layer synthesizes exactly one subtree on each side, `/sys/bus/usb` and
`/dev/bus/usb`, on top of a `/sys` and a `/dev/bus` that a sysroot supplies.
Which of the two answers a name is one decision, taken once in
`classify_and_normalize`, and every entry point -- `open`, `stat`, `lstat`,
`readlink`, `access`, `getdents64`, `statfs`, `chdir` -- answers from it.
An entry point that re-derives the decision is how four regressions arrived,
each one a shadow: the layer claiming a name it does not serve and reporting
`ENOENT` for a file the sysroot really has.

The classes and who answers them:

| Class | Path | Answered by |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `USB_PATH_SYS` | `/sys[/suffix]` | the layer, if the folded suffix resolves in the scratch tree; otherwise the backing, unless the suffix is under `bus/usb`, where an absence is authoritative |
| `USB_PATH_DEV_BUS` | `/dev/bus` | both: a union listing, synthetic `usb` plus the backing's names |
| `USB_PATH_DEV_USB` | `/dev/bus/usb` | the layer |
| `USB_PATH_DEV_BUSNUM` | `/dev/bus/usb/BBB` | the layer |
| `USB_PATH_DEV_NODE` | `/dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD` | the layer |
| `USB_PATH_DEV_NODE_SUB` | a node used as a directory | the layer (`ENOTDIR` once the node exists) |
| `USB_PATH_DEV_ABSENT` | under `/dev/bus/usb`, no such device | the layer, `ENOENT` |
| `USB_PATH_DEV_FOREIGN` | under `/dev/bus`, a bus we do not model | the backing |
| `USB_PATH_NONE` | anything else, and a name that folds above its root | the backing |

Only `PROC_NOT_INTERCEPTED` means "ask the backing". A name the layer claims
and then fails to serve is an answer, not a fall-through: taking the failure
for one let `access(2)`, and then `statfs(2)`, answer from the backing while
`open` and `stat` reported `ENOENT` for the same path.

`.` and `..` are folded lexically before ownership is decided, on both halves.
The fold is the ours/not-ours gate and nothing else -- the served path is built
by `usb_sys_resolve_suffix`, which resolves symlinks and applies each `..` to
what the previous component resolved to, the way the kernel does, so
`<dev>/subsystem/..` names `/sys/bus`. Deciding ownership on the guest's
spelling instead splits the two halves apart in both directions:
`/dev/bus/usb/../other/f` reads as a malformed device number and is claimed,
and `/dev/bus/other/../usb/001/002` reads as a foreign bus and is disowned.
A suffix that folds away above its own root leaves as `USB_PATH_NONE`.

### Filesystem Identity Of A Descriptor

Two questions have one answer here: what `statfs` reports for a name, and what
`fstatfs` reports for a descriptor opened by that name. systemd's `sd-device`
gates every enumerated syspath on `fstatfs(fd) == SYSFS_MAGIC` and libusb gates
on `statfs("/sys")`, so a build where the two disagree is one where a device
enumerates through one library and not the other.

The rules:

- `/sys`, whichever side served it, reports `SYSFS_MAGIC` (`0x62656572`). That
  covers the scratch-dir backed names, where the host `fstatfs` would leak the
  `/tmp` filesystem's magic, and the ones that fell through to a sysroot's own
  `/sys`, where it would leak the sysroot's.
- `/dev/bus` reports devtmpfs, on both entry points.
- `..` is folded and a relative name is resolved against the cwd before either
  entry point decides, so the two cannot be handed different spellings of one
  object.

A descriptor's identity comes from the virtual path stamped on its slot when
this layer served the open, and from the descriptor's own host path mapped back
through the sysroot when there is no stamp -- a fall-through open stamps
nothing, which is exactly the case that used to make `statfs("/sys/class")`
report `SYSFS_MAGIC` while `fstatfs` on the fd it had just opened reported the
sysroot's filesystem.

`fstat` answers from the stamp for `O_PATH` descriptors and for `/sys` and
`/dev/bus` names, because the object behind a `/dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD` node is a
placeholder file: libusb `fstat`s the node it just opened and refuses anything
that is not a character device, so the descriptor has to report the character
device the path side described. `/proc` stays `O_PATH`-only there: its
descriptors are real host files whose contents are the answer, and stamping
their type would misdescribe the object the guest is reading.

The stamp and the descriptor are read in one `fd_lock` window
(`host_fd_ref_open_entry`). They are two facts about one open file description,
and read separately a close and reopen between them gives the stamp of one and
the descriptor of another.

### Union Directory Listings

A directory that exists on both sides -- `/sys`, `/dev/bus` -- lists the union.
`sys_getdents64` walks the synthetic (primary) stream first and then the names
drained out of the backing; the drain opens the backing directory and closes it
before returning, so elfuse keeps its promise of one host descriptor per guest
fd and a union directory costs no more than a plain one.

What the guest is told when part of the listing cannot be delivered is the
contract that matters, because the failure mode is silent: a listing that lost
a name and still ends at `0` is an end-of-directory the guest cannot tell from
a real one, and having read it, it never asks again.

- A failure that costs the stream names it can never produce again -- a drain
  that failed part-way, a primary `readdir` that stopped -- is recorded in
  `listing_errno`. It is sticky: every later call on that fd fails the same
  way. Linux has no case that re-delivers an error on a directory stream, so
  there is no shape to copy; clearing it would put the next call back on the
  silent path, and the stream has nothing truthful left to return.
- Linux's two-part shape is followed for reporting one: a call that has already
  written entries returns their count and leaves the error for the next call; a
  call that has written nothing returns `-1` with the errno.
- A buffer too small to hold one entry is `EINVAL`, not `0`. Measured on Linux
  over a directory holding a twelve-byte name: `getdents64` with 8- and
  16-byte buffers returns `EINVAL` immediately, and with 24 bytes it delivers
  the names that fit and then reports.
- No exit from the walk may consume an entry without putting it back. The
  entry-does-not-fit path and the guest-write fault path both rewind the
  primary with `seekdir`; the backing side rewinds by not advancing its cursor.
- A host name too long for Linux `NAME_MAX` is skipped, and the rest of the
  stream is delivered. This is an elfuse compatibility policy with no Linux
  counterpart: Linux enforces `NAME_MAX` at the filesystem layer, so no
  oversize entry ever reaches `getdents64` there. macOS APFS accepts them, and
  aborting the stream truncated `ls` / `find` listings against APFS trees.

`dir_stream_t` is the wrapper around the `DIR*`. It is refcounted and carries
its own lock, so an in-flight `getdents64` pins it against a sibling's
`close()`; `dup`, `dup2` and `F_DUPFD` share one wrapper rather than opening a
second, which is what makes two guest fds on one open file description share
one position and one union state. A forked child's inherited fds share one
wrapper per inherited open file description for the same reason. The wrapper
owns the descriptor it was opened on -- only `closedir()` gives it back -- so
an alias names the descriptor the shared wrapper holds and the redundant one is
closed.

A stream built for an inherited descriptor has `backing_private` set: the
primary is shared with the parent through the description and must be read, and
the backing belongs to whichever stream first ran out of primary and must not
be drained twice. `docs/testing.md` records the one state this cannot deliver
whole.

### Limits Of The IOKit Mapping

This tree enumerates devices; the pieces that follow open them and
move data. It is worth stating where the approach stops, because three
of the limits are macOS policy that no amount of translation moves, and
the rest cost something permanent. The short version: the layer is
complete for devices macOS does not claim, honest but limited for the
ones it does, and structurally unable to present bus topology.

Driver arbitration decides which devices are reachable at all. Once a
class driver matches an interface, `USBInterfaceOpen` returns
`kIOReturnExclusiveAccess`, and an unprivileged process has no way past
it. On the ESP32-S3 used to develop this: interface 0 (CDC control) is
held by `AppleUSBACMControl` and always refuses, interface 1 (CDC data)
refuses whenever anything holds a `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` node, and
interface 2 (a vendor JTAG class with no matching driver) opens freely.
The documented escape, `USBDeviceReEnumerate` with
`kUSBReEnumerateCaptureDeviceMask`, needs root or the
`com.apple.vm.device-access` entitlement; an unentitled non-root caller
gets a success return that changes nothing, the registry ID and the
driver binding both intact. Mass storage is excluded from capture
outright. So the layer serves vendor and bulk devices completely, while
CDC and HID stay reachable only through the interfaces macOS already
exposes -- `/dev/cu.*` and `IOHIDManager`. This is why the ttyACM /
ttyUSB aliasing is a companion to the USB layer rather than a workaround
for it.

Cancellation granularity differs in a way that costs throughput.
`USBDEVFS_DISCARDURB` cancels one URB; IOKit's `AbortPipe` cancels
everything outstanding on the pipe. Preserving the Linux semantics means
queueing inside elfuse and handing IOKit one transfer per endpoint at a
time, which gives up the pipelining a bulk-heavy workload depends on.
The alternative -- report the collateral cancellations as `-ECONNRESET`
and let the guest resubmit, which libusb and nusb both do -- lets a
cancel on one transfer disturb unrelated ones. Neither choice is free,
and no macOS API removes the tradeoff.

Reset is an unplug. `ResetDevice` has been a no-op since OS X 10.11, so
the only real reset is `USBDeviceReEnumerate`, which tears down the user
client and re-runs matching. Linux `USBDEVFS_RESET` keeps the fd valid
and the device numbering stable. Emulating it means holding `busnum` and
`devnum` steady across a registry identity that changed underneath,
waiting for the re-attach, and diffing descriptors afterward -- and
distinguishing "came back different" from "never came back", since
firmware update flows (DFU) are both the workflow that leans on reset
and the one where the descriptors legitimately change.

Identity is topological, not device-based. A `locationID` encodes the
port path, so unplugging one device and plugging another into the same
port yields the same value. The enumeration cross-checks `idVendor`,
`idProduct` and the serial string against the cached model and answers
`-ENODEV` on a mismatch, which is safe but not complete: the model is a
one-shot snapshot with no hotplug observer, so a device attached mid-run
is unusable until the process restarts. Real hotplug would rewrite IOKit
attach and detach notifications as uevents on the netlink socket -- a
fair amount of machinery for something libusb tolerates the absence of.

Bus topology has no macOS source, the boundary noted above: macOS
publishes no root hub as a USB device, so there is no `usbN` entry, no
parent link, and `lsusb -t` loses its bus rows. A plausible root hub
could be synthesized, but it would be a device no registry entry backs,
and its `maxchild`, port numbering and `/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1` node
would be invention too. The tree stays short rather than carrying a
fabricated node.

Two narrower ones. Isochronous transfers need explicit frame scheduling
through `GetBusFrameNumber`, where usbfs lets `URB_ISO_ASAP` hand the
timing to the controller, so audio and video capture do not map cleanly.
And the permission models do not correspond: Linux gates usbfs through
udev rules and file permissions, macOS gates IOKit through driver
matching and entitlements, and there is no single spelling of "let this
program use this device" that means the same on both.

## Path Resolution

A guest names files the way Linux does, from a namespace rooted at the guest's
`/`. The host has its own root, and with `--sysroot` the guest's tree is a
subdirectory of it. Every path-taking syscall therefore asks two questions
before it can act, and `path_translate_at()` in `src/syscall/path.c` answers
both in one place so no two syscalls can answer them differently for the same
name:

1. Does the sysroot claim this path? A path it holds resolves there; one it
   does not falls back to the host filesystem, except for the guest system
   directories and the temp roots, which resolve in the sysroot whether or not
   it holds them.
2. What host spelling does it get? That is the sysroot prefix plus the guest
   path, adjusted so the host kernel's own resolution lands where Linux's
   would.

Three resolvers in `src/syscall/proc-state.c` do the work:
`proc_resolve_sysroot_path()` for a following lookup, its
`_nofollow_` sibling, and `proc_resolve_sysroot_create_path()` for a path whose
final component may not exist yet. `path_translate_at()` picks one by flags;
`sys_path_has_symlink()` calls the nofollow form directly for absolute paths
in the `openat2(RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS)` precheck described below, and walks
relative paths from their descriptor with the same clamp applied in the walk.

### Folding `//` And `.`

Linux steps over `//` runs and `.` components in the walk every path syscall
shares, so `//sys/bus`, `/./sys/bus` and `/sys/./bus` are `/sys/bus` to all of
them. The intercepts match literal prefixes, so `path_translate_at()` folds an
absolute name once, before any of them reads it.

Two things stay as written. `..` is not folded, because Linux applies it to
what the component before it resolved to. And a `.` that is the last component
keeps its place, because that is where Linux gives it a meaning of its own:
`rmdir("d/.")` is `EINVAL` where `rmdir("d/")` removes `d`.

What a final `.` or a trailing slash means to a lookup is a requirement: the
name has to resolve to a directory, following a final symlink to get there. The
host walk applies it for itself. The intercepts match names literally, so
`proc_intercept_open()`, `proc_intercept_stat_at()` and
`proc_intercept_readlink()` take the requirement off the name once, dispatch on
the bare name, and enforce it on the answer: a served directory answers as
itself, anything else answers `ENOTDIR`, and `readlink` of a served directory
answers `EINVAL`. The gates in `path.c` read the bare name for the same reason.

`tests/test-path-fold.c` holds every respelling of a name to the answer its
canonical spelling gets, and both endings to what Linux makes of them.

### Clamping `..` At The Guest Root

A guest resolves `..` against its own root, and Linux clamps it there: `/..`
names `/`, and no number of `..` components reaches the directory above
(`path_resolution(7)`). The sysroot is an ordinary directory on the host, so
the host kernel has somewhere to go, and a guest path handed over unchanged
climbs straight out of the tree.

`clamp_dotdot_at_guest_root()` rewrites exactly the components that would do
that, and nothing else:

| guest path | host spelling below the sysroot | why |
|---|---|---|
| `/..`, `/../..` | `/` | the clamp, applied once per escaping component |
| `/../etc/hosts` | `/etc/hosts` | the escaping `..` is dropped, the rest is untouched |
| `/a/../b` | `/a/../b` | interior, so the host resolves it |
| `/a/../../etc/x` | `/a/../etc/x` | one `..` is interior, the second escapes |
| `/file/.`, `/file/` | unchanged | the trailing form still demands a directory |

Interior `..` survives on purpose. Collapsing it would spell a path whose
popped components the host never looks at, and their existence and type are
part of the answer Linux owes: `/absent/../b` is `ENOENT`, `/file/../b` is
`ENOTDIR`, `rmdir("/a/b/..")` fails rather than removing `/a`, and a `..` past
a symlink keeps that link in the path where the no-symlinks precheck can see
it. Only the host walk can report those, so only the host walk decides them.

Two spellings of a path therefore travel together: the clamped one, which is
probed and handed to the syscall, and the fully collapsed one from
`lexical_normalize_absolute_path()`, which is used solely to classify the path
as a guest system directory or a temp root, where `/usr/../home/x` must be
judged as `/home/x` rather than by its leading component.

### Relative Paths And The Containment Recheck

The resolvers key off a leading `/`, so a relative path reaches them
unchanged: they have no dirfd to rebuild a location from. That would leave
`openat(dirfd, name)` to the host kernel, whose resolution is not confined to
the sysroot, so `path_check_relative_sysroot_containment()` reconstructs the
absolute guest path from the descriptor's guest base path and runs it back
through the same resolver.

A reconstructed path that climbs above the guest root needs more than a
verdict. Clamping makes the guest's own answer well defined, but the host
still holds a descriptor from which `..` leads out of the sysroot, and the
recheck cannot express "contained, but not by that route": a path the sysroot
does not claim looks the same as one that never left. So when the
reconstruction clamps, the recheck hands back the absolute host path it
resolved and the caller uses that instead of the guest's relative spelling.
POSIX has the kernel ignore `dirfd` for an absolute path, so the descriptor
drops out of the resolution entirely, which is the point.

A climbed path is the one case where the recheck's answer is the resolution
itself rather than a discarded verdict, so it also honors the caller's create
intent: missing sysroot parents are materialized exactly as they would be for
the absolute spelling.

### Why The No-Symlinks Precheck Has No Component Budget

`openat2(RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS)` must fail with `ELOOP` if any component of the
path is a symlink. macOS has no equivalent flag, so `sys_path_has_symlink()`
walks the path itself, one component at a time, and reports `ELOOP` at the
first `S_ISLNK`.

An absolute path is walked in its host spelling, which the resolvers have
already clamped. A dirfd-relative path is walked from the descriptor, so the
clamp happens in the walk: the descriptor's guest depth seeds a counter, and a
`..` that would climb above the guest root stays in place instead of stepping
onto the sysroot's host parent, whose entries, macOS's own symlinks among
them, are not the guest's to trip over.

That walk deliberately carries no `MAXSYMLINKS` counter. It never follows a
link, so nothing can accumulate against a link budget; the only thing a
per-component counter could reject is a link-free path deeper than the limit,
which Linux resolves without complaint, since `path_resolution(7)` caps links
followed rather than components walked. The counter that does matter lives in
`path_openat2_crosses_mount()`, which follows links to answer
`RESOLVE_NO_XDEV` and charges `MAXSYMLINKS` once per link actually crossed.

Related implementation: `src/syscall/path.c` (`path_translate_at`,
`path_check_relative_sysroot_containment`, `sys_path_has_symlink`,
`path_openat2_crosses_mount`), `src/syscall/proc-state.c`
(`clamp_dotdot_at_guest_root`, `sysroot_seed_host_path`, the three resolvers).
Validation: `make test-sysroot-dotdot` and `make test-sysroot-openat2-walk`,
plus the `openat2` cases in `tests/test-syscall-fidelity.c`, which
`make test-matrix` runs against both `elfuse` and a reference kernel.

## POSIX Shared Memory (`/dev/shm`)

Linux exposes POSIX shared memory through `/dev/shm`, a tmpfs the C library
opens by name: `shm_open("/foo", ...)` opens `/dev/shm/foo`. macOS has no
`/dev/shm`, so `elfuse` backs it with a per-UID host directory,
`/tmp/elfuse-shm-<uid>/<name>`. `dev_shm_resolve_path()` in
`src/runtime/procemu.c` (exported as `proc_dev_shm_resolve`) is the single
source of truth for that mapping and gates the name. This is a different
mechanism from System V shared memory (`shmget`/`shmat`), which lives in
`src/syscall/sysvipc.c`.

### One Redirect, One Resolution

Every path syscall resolves guest paths through `path_translate_at()` in
`src/syscall/path.c`. For a `/dev/shm/<leaf>` path it rewrites `host_path` into
the backing directory and records the fact in `tx->is_dev_shm`. If each syscall
applied the redirect on its own, any that missed it would fall through to the
sysroot while its peers used the backing directory, so `/dev/shm/foo` would
resolve two ways for the same program:

```
/dev/shm/foo
  open  -> /tmp/elfuse-shm-<uid>/foo   (backing dir, created)
  chmod -> <sysroot>/dev/shm/foo       (absent -> ENOENT)
```

Resolving in `path_translate_at` instead means `chmod`, `chown`, `truncate`,
`utimensat`, `rename`, `link`, `symlink`, `mknod`, `readlink`, `mkdir`,
`statfs`, and the xattr calls all inherit the backing path from one place, so an
`open` followed by any of them on the same name stays consistent.

The early return also takes shm objects out of sysroot resolution entirely, so
the `/tmp/elfuse-shm-<uid>` backing directory is reached as a host path and is
unaffected by the sysroot's redirect of guest `/tmp`.

Only a non-empty flat leaf is redirected. Bare `/dev/shm` and `/dev/shm/` stay
on the sysroot path so the synthetic-directory intercepts keep answering for
them, and `statfs` on a shm leaf or on `/dev/shm` reports `TMPFS_MAGIC`
synthetically rather than the host filesystem's type. Because the backing path
is absolute, two inline helpers in `src/syscall/path.h` adapt the `*at()` calls:
`path_translation_dirfd()` returns `AT_FDCWD` (POSIX ignores `dirfd` for an
absolute path), and `path_translation_at_flags()` forces the nofollow flag
described next.

### The Never-Follow Invariant

On Linux `/dev/shm` is an in-namespace tmpfs, so a symlink planted at a shm leaf
resolves inside that namespace. `elfuse`'s backing store is a plain host
directory, so the same symlink would resolve onto the host filesystem, which is
a sandbox escape. A symlink leaf is never legitimate anyway: glibc's `shm_open`
(`sysdeps/posix/shm_open.c`) opens objects with `O_NOFOLLOW`. So every shm
operation acts on the leaf itself, never the target it points at. Because the
resolver hands back an absolute host path that bypasses the sysroot, that duty
is spread across the syscall families, one mechanism each:

| Operation family | Never-follow mechanism |
|------------------|------------------------|
| `*at()` metadata (chmod, chown, stat, utimensat, access) | `path_translation_at_flags()` adds `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` |
| open for truncate/chdir | `shm_open_leaf()` opens `O_NOFOLLOW` |
| proc open | `O_NOFOLLOW` |
| xattr get/set/list/remove | `XATTR_NOFOLLOW` |
| stat | `lstat`, not `stat` |
| linkat | clears `AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW` |
| statfs | nofollow `lstat` existence probe, then a synthetic reply |

The name gate lives with the resolver. A POSIX shm name is always a single flat
component: glibc's `__shm_get_name` (`posix/shm-directory.c`) strips the leading
slash and rejects an empty name or any embedded `/` with `EINVAL`.
`dev_shm_resolve_path()` enforces the same shape, additionally rejects the `..`
component (a flat name like `a..b` is fine), and returns `EACCES` for a
rejected name (`ENAMETOOLONG` if the backing path overflows).

Related implementation: `src/runtime/procemu.c` (`dev_shm_resolve_path`),
`src/syscall/path.c` and `path.h` (`path_translate_at`, `is_dev_shm`,
`path_translation_dirfd`, `path_translation_at_flags`), and the metadata
handlers in `src/syscall/fs.c`, `fs-stat.c`, and `fs-xattr.c`. Validation:
`tests/test-dev-shm-paths.c`.

## Dynamic Linking

`elfuse` supports dynamically linked aarch64-linux ELF binaries via
`--sysroot`:

```sh
elfuse --sysroot /path/to/sysroot ./my-dynamic-program
```

How it works:

1. `elf_load()` parses `PT_INTERP` to find the interpreter path
   (`/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1` for glibc, `/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` for
   musl).
2. The interpreter is loaded as `ET_DYN` at `g->interp_base` (computed
   dynamically: 60 GiB for 36-bit IPA, 1020 GiB for 40-bit IPA).
3. `build_linux_stack()` passes `AT_BASE` (interpreter load address) and
   `AT_EXECFN` (the execve filename, supplied by the caller) in the auxiliary
   vector. Linux takes `AT_EXECFN` from `bprm->filename`, so it stays the
   program the guest asked for even when `argv[0]` is an alternate name or the
   rosetta binfmt_misc argv prepends the translator.
4. The entry point becomes `interp_entry + load_base`; the dynamic linker
   takes over from there.
5. Guest absolute paths reach the host through `path_translate_at()`
   (`src/syscall/path.c`), the single forward resolver every path-taking
   handler uses; with `--sysroot` set it dispatches each path between the
   sysroot and the host on existence. The temp roots (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, any
   `.ccache` directory) and the guest system directories are exempt from that
   dispatch and resolve in the sysroot either way, so lookup and removal cannot
   disagree about where a path lives. [filenames.md](filenames.md) covers how
   a name is spelled once it lands on the sysroot volume.

The sysroot is inherited by fork children via IPC state transfer.
`sys_execve` also loads the interpreter for dynamically linked targets, so
tools that `execve` dynamic children (`env`, `nice`, `nohup`) work
correctly. The two loaders resolve `PT_INTERP` in different orders.
Guest-issued execs route it through `path_translate_at()` like any other
guest path. The initial process is loaded by the core bootstrap
(`load_interpreter()` in `src/core/bootstrap.c`), which probes
`elf_resolve_interp()` (`src/core/elf.c`) first, a literal sysroot
concatenation plus a `/lib/<basename>` fallback, and only when both
probes miss does it fall through to `path_translate_at()`, materializing
a FUSE interpreter and refusing one in `/dev/shm`.

### Known Limitations

None specific to the aarch64-linux dynamic-linker path. Limitations in guest
path handling are covered by [filenames.md](filenames.md), which records what
the sysroot volume can and cannot represent.

## x86_64-via-Apple-Rosetta

`src/core/rosetta.c` hosts Apple's Rosetta Linux translator inside the
same VM that runs aarch64 guests, so statically linked x86_64-linux ELFs
execute through a translator the host process owns rather than an
external translation service. The guest architecture is auto-detected
from the ELF header; opt out via `--no-rosetta` or `ELFUSE_NO_ROSETTA=1`.

Address-space layout:

- The translator lives in the primary buffer at a low guest physical
  address but is mapped at its link address `0x800000000000` via a
  non-identity page-table entry. This works around the 36-bit Stage-2
  IPA cap on M1 / M2.
- A 256 MiB kernel buffer (kbuf) at `g->kbuf_gpa` is aliased at
  `KBUF_VA_BASE = 0xFFFFFFFFF0000000` under TTBR1 and at
  `KBUF_USER_VA = KBUF_VA_BASE & 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF` under TTBR0, so
  Rosetta's TaggedPointer extraction resolves both views to the same
  physical pages. The kbuf is always RW; nothing executable is
  installed there.
- M5 hosts bisect the primary slab from 1 TiB to 256 GiB or 64 GiB on
  `hv_vm_map` failure while keeping the IPA width at 48 so the high-VA
  Stage-2 entries remain reachable.

Runtime integration:

- The VZ ioctls (`CHECK 0x80456125`, `CAPS 0x80806123`,
  `ACTIVATE 0x6124`) are trapped when `g->is_rosetta` is set.
- `/proc/self/exe` is redirected to `ROSETTA_PATH` (the binfmt-misc
  convention Rosetta expects).
- The `rosettad` SCM_RIGHTS bridge implements an SHA-256-keyed AOT cache
  under `$HOME/.cache/elfuse-rosettad/`. First launch warms the cache;
  subsequent launches reuse translations.

Fork interaction: the CoW shm fast path is disabled for Rosetta because
HVF caches host VA-to-PA at `hv_vm_map` time. Rosetta forks use the
legacy IPC copy path.

Dynamic linking under Rosetta is supported. For x86_64 guests with a
`PT_INTERP` header, elfuse does not load the ELF segments or the
interpreter from the host side; `bootstrap_prepare` deliberately skips
the aarch64 loader path (`src/core/bootstrap.c:415-462`) and instead
hands control to Rosetta. The translator then opens the guest ELF
through Linux syscalls, reads `PT_INTERP`, and `mmap`s
`/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` (or the musl equivalent) from the
sysroot. The translated dynamic linker loads shared libraries via the
same path. Coverage lives in `tests/test-rosetta-glibc.sh`, which
exercises direct loader bring-up, explicit `ld.so` invocation,
`ld.so --list`, runtime `dlopen`, initial-exec TLS, general-dynamic
TLS via `dlopen`, and per-pthread TLS.

Boundaries:

- `--gdb` is rejected because the stub serves the aarch64 view Rosetta
  produces, not the original x86_64 architectural state.
- Two Rosetta-internal divergences are tracked in the acceptance audit
  rather than papered over: `SA_RESETHAND` is shadowed by Rosetta's own
  signal-handler state, and `clone(..., CLONE_SETTLS, tls=0, ...)` can
  hang.

## GDB Stub

`src/debug/` is split by role:

- `gdbstub.c` -- session lifecycle, stop/resume flow, packet dispatch
- `gdbstub-rsp.c` -- RSP packet transport and hex helpers
- `gdbstub-reg.c` -- register snapshot layout, restore flow, `target.xml`

The stub runs in all-stop mode. Because Hypervisor.framework register access
must happen on the owning thread, the stopped vCPU snapshots its own state;
the GDB-handler thread reads and updates the snapshot, and the owning thread
restores the modified state on resume -- the same pattern used by ptrace.

The split mirrors the architectural boundary: transport and encoding are
independent of guest execution; register layout is independent of socket I/O;
stop/resume sequencing remains tightly coupled to process and thread state.

## Language Choice

`elfuse` is C11 plus a small amount of aarch64 assembly. This section records
why, against the specifics of this codebase rather than in the abstract.

### Where The Safety Boundary Falls

The central data structure is a slab of guest memory obtained from `mmap`,
which the guest rewrites at will from another vCPU thread. Host access goes
through bounds-checked accessors over that slab: `guest_ptr`, `guest_ptr_w`,
`guest_ptr_avail`, `guest_ptr_bound`, `guest_read`, and `guest_write` (see
[Memory Layout](#memory-layout)), each resolving a guest-controlled address
against the recorded mappings.

Rust would express the same shape as a safe wrapper over an `unsafe` core,
and would enforce that callers stay on the safe side, which C leaves to
convention. That enforcement is a real gain. What it does not do is validate
the checks inside the wrapper, and those checks are where the defects below
live: the interior of the guest slab, the page-table walk itself, and syscall
arguments arriving as guest-controlled integers.

### What Defects Surface In Practice

One worked example, from the loader. A PT_LOAD whose `p_vaddr + p_memsz`
overflows is rejected where it is parsed, by the checked `elf_add_no_wrap`
(`src/core/elf.c`), and `verify-elf` discharges that arithmetic as a proof
obligation. Saturating `load_max` to `UINT64_MAX` is the alternative that does
not hold: every consumer adds a load base to it before comparing against
`guest_size`, so the clamp relocates the wrap into the consumer, where the
bound check it was meant to trip reads `elf_end > guest_size` and passes.
Where the image lands is a separate question, checked per segment by
`elf_place_segment` under `elf_check_placement`, which `sys_execve` calls
before its point of no return so an unplaceable image is a recoverable
`-ENOEXEC` rather than a fatal exec.

The class of defect is the point. That is integer arithmetic, not memory
safety. Rust's `+` wraps silently in release builds too, so the same checked
add is required there.

`elf_map_segments_fd` also re-reads the header and program headers from the
fd, and can disagree with the first parse: a TOCTOU on the ELF image. Its own
bounds checks contain the damage, but no language rules the disagreement out.
It is a property of how the loader is structured.

### Verification Actually In Place

The language-independent tooling gates CI: `clang-format`, a banned-API and
unsafe-preprocessor scan, `cppcheck`, and the dispatch-table consistency check
on Linux; `scan-build` as an advisory job; `clang-tidy` advisory except for
`readability-function-size`, which is named in `WarningsAsErrors` and fails the
job when a function crosses its ceiling; an Infer run that fails on any
finding; and a runtime matrix under ASAN, UBSAN, and TSAN (see [Testing And
Confidence](#testing-and-confidence)). That catches memory-safety defects after
the fact rather than excluding them by construction, which is the honest cost
of the choice.

The formal layer proves each selected function body free of arithmetic runtime
errors, assuming its stated preconditions. `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs
the targets a change can move, split between a proof leg and a per-target
mutation matrix, with a final job that requires both halves; `make verify`
runs the whole set locally. Each target names a function set and discharges
its obligations with `-wp-rte`, which adds the implicit runtime-error goals
(overflow, out-of-bounds, invalid dereference) that the ACSL contracts alone
leave open.
`verify-elf` covers the named arithmetic helpers in `src/core/elf.c`, not
`elf_load_fd`, `elf_map_segments_fd`, or their call-site preconditions; the
others cover the bounds math of the remaining attacker-facing parsers and
packers.

Two shapes, and `mk/verify.mk` is the list that says which one a target is.
Most name functions in a header under `src/proved/`, which is what lets one
`.c` file's arithmetic be proved while the rest of that file stays unparsable
to the analyzer. A few name functions in a `.c` file directly, so the loops
are proved as written rather than as a copy of the math.

Four gates close the ways a proof can say less than it appears to:

- `scripts/check-proof-targets.py` (in `make check`): nothing lands in
  `src/proved/` without a proof target.
- `scripts/check-acsl-coverage.py`: a contracted function left out of the
  proof set is an assumed axiom, so the target fails rather than trusting it.
- `make verify-mutants`: each target must reject a known-broken source, which
  is what catches a contract whose clauses do not bite.
- `make check-contracts`: rebuilds with `-DELFUSE_CONTRACT_ASSERT` so the
  expressible preconditions of `proved/gva.h` are checked on every call the
  suite makes, since `src/core/guest.c` does not parse under the analyzer and
  nothing else checks its call sites.

What the proofs do not cover: the I/O around the proved arithmetic (`pread`,
`malloc`) stays test-covered, and preconditions at call sites in files the
analyzer cannot parse are review-only. `frama-c-stubs/` supplies the Darwin
declarations the analyzer needs, held to the SDK's own values by
`scripts/check-stub-constants.py`.

### Host Interface Surface

`hv_vcpu_run`, `hv_vcpu_set_sys_reg`, Mach (`host_statistics64` behind
`/proc/meminfo`), pthreads, macOS syscalls, file descriptor passing over
`SCM_RIGHTS`, and hosting the Apple Rosetta translator are all C ABI. The EL1
shim is aarch64 assembly (`src/core/shim.S`) under any host language. A
safe-language port would spend a significant share of its effort on binding
layers for that surface.

## Testing And Confidence

`elfuse` uses several layers of validation:

- `make check` -- fast guest tests plus the BusyBox applet smoke suite,
  followed by `scripts/check-syscall-coverage.py` so any new
  `dispatch.tbl` entry without a direct or aliased test reference fails
  the build.
- `make test-busybox` -- applet coverage in isolation.
- `make test-fuse-alpine` -- guest-internal FUSE against the Alpine
  musl sysroot fixture.
- `make test-gdbstub` -- debugger integration.
- `make test-rosetta-all` -- the x86_64 acceptance sub-suites
  (CLI gating, failure modes, statics, Alpine pipelines, audit, JIT,
  glibc dynamic).
- `make test-matrix` -- cross-checks elfuse (aarch64), QEMU (aarch64),
  and elfuse (x86_64-via-Rosetta) on overlapping corpora, with per-host
  baselines for the Rosetta branch.
- `make verify` and `make verify-mutants`: the Frama-C WP proof targets, and
  the assertion that each of them rejects a known-broken source. Run the two
  together, and not beside a timing lane, because both fan out and the timed
  lanes fail under the load they create.

The rule for contributors is simple: match the validation depth to the
subsystem you changed. Procfs, process state, dynamic linking, and
debugging typically warrant more than `make check`. Touching the
Rosetta path additionally requires `make test-rosetta-all` so the
acceptance audit catches new divergences from the documented
Rosetta-internal failures. See [testing.md](testing.md) for the full
target list, per-host baseline scheme, and the validation-by-change-type
table.
