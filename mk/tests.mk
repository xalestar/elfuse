.PHONY: check-asan check-ubsan check-tsan check-sanitizer

# Sanitizer builds target elfuse's own internals, not Linux syscall
# compatibility -- the release lane already covers that via test-matrix. So the
# check-{asan,ubsan,tsan} entry points run check-sanitizer, a representative
# subset of manifest sections that stress concurrency, memory, fork, and signal
# machinery (where ASAN/UBSAN/TSAN actually find bugs) instead of the full
# check suite.
#
# Sanitized guests run several times slower, so widen the per-test timeout
# (test-runner.sh defaults to 10s) to keep the slowdown from surfacing as a
# spurious TIMEOUT. TEST_TIMEOUT is only overridden if the caller has not
# already set one.
#
# ASAN was raised from 30 after test-dup-setfl-race, whose 700 rounds take ~10s
# under ASAN on an idle host, timed out on a CI runner that shares its machine
# with a second runner. These defaults are for a local run: CI never reaches
# these targets, it sets TEST_TIMEOUT itself in .github/workflows/build.yml.
# The two are policy for different machines and may legitimately differ.

# No "clean" prerequisite. These lanes used to depend on it, which removed the
# whole build tree including the 186 cross-compiled guest binaries -- built with
# CROSS_TEST_CFLAGS, and so untouched by anything EXTRA_CFLAGS says. The FLAVOR
# stamp in mk/common.mk was added later to solve the same problem exactly:
# it removes the *.o and *.d that a CFLAGS change actually invalidates, and
# leaves the rest. Measured on this tree, the clean cost 186 needless
# cross-compiles per sanitizer run, most of the lane's wall time.
#
# What still protects the link is the stamp, not the clean: the sub-make below
# re-reads common.mk with the sanitizer CFLAGS, sees a different flavor, and
# drops every host object before anything is compiled or linked.

#
# The USB tree is reached through CHECK_SHARED_LANES rather than through a

# It belongs on the sanitizer lane all the same -- the layer composes a dev_t

# adjudicate, and nothing else on the lane builds that tree.

# fd -- before the bind, where a close finds no entry, and after it, where a
# close can reap the entry and a sibling open can take the slot back -- and the
# window a reap leaves between the fd-table snapshot it settles readiness from
# and the side-table entry it settles it on. Each run below forces exactly one
# and the binary asserts only that one, so a failure names the condition. The
# malformed-descriptor run is also where the out-of-bounds read lives: it is

## Build the fixture-enabled binary the two loopback lanes run
#
# The loopback fixture is not in the default build (USB_LOOPBACK_FIXTURE in
# mk/config.mk), so a lane that needs it has to ask for a binary that has it.
# Asking is a recursive make with the variable set rather than a second link
# line here, so what the lanes run is the build a reader gets from
# "make USB_LOOPBACK_FIXTURE=1" and cannot drift from it, and so nothing in this
# file has to restate the prerequisites of $(ELFUSE_BIN).
#
# Into a binary of its own, so a plain make still leaves build/elfuse without
# the fixture: the sub-make overrides ELFUSE_BIN rather than BUILD_DIR, which
# keeps every object but the fixture's shared with the outer build. Overriding
# BUILD_DIR instead would recompile the tree.
#
# Phony because the sub-make is what decides whether anything needs rebuilding.
# The leading '+' is what keeps it expanding under -n: make looks for a literal
# $(MAKE) in the unexpanded recipe line (make manual 9.3). A command-line
# override reaches a sub-make through MAKEFLAGS, so the sanitizer lanes get a
# loopback binary of their own flavor without this line naming EXTRA_CFLAGS.

## A dup'd directory fd must share one listing position and one union state
# Both directories the lane walks are staged several hundred names wide, and

# that block: a stream that never reads its primary loses nothing, and the loss

# pair when the sharing is right, 340 when the child skips its primary. The
# union side is staged wide for the mirror-image reason -- a backing delivered a
